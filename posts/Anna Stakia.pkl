V I was recently honored to be accepted to participate in the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting which took place in the week of 26/6 \u2013 1/7/2016 in Lindau, Germany. Introducing a bit this year\u2019s meeting: 400 young scientists from 80 countries were provided the opportunity for an in-depth exchange with 29 Nobel Prize and one Turing Award Laureates. This year\u2019s Meeting was mostly dedicated to Physics (most Nobel Laureates had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, fewer in Chemistry). Well, I frankly don\u2019t know where to begin when it comes to describing this spectacular event. Still there is a mixture of three words which could maybe represent it, the ones that are already included in the Meeting\u2019s trademark: \u2018Educate\u2019, \u2018Inspire\u2019, \u2018Connect\u2019. We indeed had the incredible opportunity to gain significant knowledge and ideas through the lectures, be inspired and motivated by the Laureates, and become acquainted with male and female young scientists from all around the world, studying different fields of Physics (the latter practically defining diversity). In fact, the Nobel Laureate \u2013 young scientists\u2019 interaction would include our asking questions directly to the Laureates and discussing several modern scientific issues/challenges/concerns with them, during the coffee breaks or even during lunch/dinner. Education-wise, the Meeting may be divided into the following parts: lectures, panel discussions, young scientists discussions, master classes, science breakfast \u2013 lunch \u2013 dinner sessions, poster session. In this article, I\u2019ll be mostly making an attempt to describe briefly the lectures of this event. This way people who participated can refresh their memory on it and people who haven\u2019t had the chance yet to be introduced to the core of some of the lectures may be prompted to watch the corresponding material uploaded on the Mediatheque. I also include some hints of the overall experience, so as to share the feelings we, the young scientists who participated, had while being an active part of it. An important thing to be mentioned is that, during the Meeting days, one could visit the \u2018Pablo Picasso\u2019s Passions\u2019 exhibition held in the Stadtmuseum (Lindau) as well as the \u2018Exhibition Johannes Kepler\u2019 in the Former Imperial City Library, both very close to the Stadttheater (Lindau), where the lectures/panel discussions were held. In the latter, one could admire rare first edition prints of works by Kepler, Copernicus, Galilei, and also of Newton\u2019s \u2018Principia Mathematica\u2019! 1st day \u2013 June 26 This was the first and last day that was not (extremely) full of events. Besides the registration process, it consisted of the opening ceremony, which left us with the best of impressions as a representative introduction to what would follow. Specifically, it included welcome speeches by eminent personalities and some marvellous musical pieces conducted by the Ensemble of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. 2nd day \u2013 June 27 This day was the starting point of the Meeting\u2019s core timetable; first day of the lectures and of the active interaction with the Nobel Laureates. I personally attended the \u201cQuantum Information: from Fundamentals to a New Technology\u201d Science Breakfast, which happened to be scheduled for that day, and which was hosted by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy. William D. Philips (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1997) and David J. Wineland (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2012), as participants of that Breakfast, expressed their interesting views on future challenges in Quantum Information, and were the first two Nobel Laureates we got to meet. Right after the Breakfast the lecture sessions began. In the first lecture, Hiroshi Amano (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2014) outlined the blue LED creation steps and its extended use: from smartphones and highly efficient/energy saving white-light illumination (not only in developed countries, but even in the temporary shelters of nomadic groups) to water purification (Deep UV LED), showing how innovation in Materials Science and Engineering can notably increase the quality of life worldwide. Later on, Takaaki Kajita (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2015) described the significant results brought by two of the biggest atmospheric neutrino experiments, Kamiokande and its successor, Super-Kamiokande, regarding the first observation of a deficit in the muon-neutrino events and the final evidence for neutrino oscillations, respectively; the latter implies non-zero neutrino masses, thus enhancing the search for Physics beyond the Standard Model. The next lecture was given by David J. Gross (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2004), and, on the occasion of the celebration of 100 years of General Relativity, was about Einstein\u2019s enduring legacy. After successfully reconciling Maxwell\u2019s Electromagnetism and Newtonian motion to a Theory of Invariance (Special Relativity) under a principle of symmetry (no privileged observers), Einstein subsequently reconciled this theory with Newtonian gravity introducing gravitational waves (observed for the first time last year by LIGO) in a dynamical spacetime and so General Relativity was derived. Apart from this brilliant theory, and among many other remarkable scientific contributions, Einstein also managed not only to radically change our view of Physical Cosmology but also to trigger the search for a Unified Theory, raising questions that are yet to be answered. Later, Carlo Rubbia (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1984) presented the Earth\u2019s climate change over time and described how the survival threats due to the \u201cman-made Anthropogenic Era\u201d can be considerably reduced; renewable energy (and its efficient transportation) and Natural Gas (even more, in spontaneous thermal decomposition), as key parts of the energy policy worldwide, could substantially help sustain human civilization on Earth in the far future. Next, Martinus J. G. Veltman (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1999) discussed how a regulator mechanism helps us cancel out infinities met along our studies (and seen in the Feynman diagrams), and, provided it respects expected properties, how it may end up in the discovery of a new particle undergoing specific interactions; that was the case for the Higgs particle, whose great importance lies in making the theory of Yang-Mills fields renormalizable. Arthur B. McDonald (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2015) then outlined the (underground, low radioactivity) experiments conducted in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory related to solar neutrino studies, describing the three major experimental phases and the remarkable outcome of the observed change in the electron neutrino type, which further implies a finite mass. Future challenges include Dark Matter searches and neutrino-less double beta decay. This afternoon panel discussion on \u2018Glimpses beyond the Standard Model\u2019 was conducted not only by the Nobel Laureates (Chu, Gross, Kajita, Rubbia) and the young scientists who had the opportunity to interact as well, but also by Fabiola Gianotti (Director-General of CERN), via video live stream from CERN, who shared with the audience up-to-the-moment news on the LHC performance (achieving its design luminosity, one day before!). Without a doubt, that was one of the (actually many) exciting events this Meeting offered. Later that day, we had a wonderful boat-trip to Bregenz, Austria, where, after attending the live cultural performance by an Austrian music group (Federspiel), we had a nice dinner together with the Laureates. David J. Gross (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2004) during his lecture 3rd day \u2013 June 28 In this day\u2019s first lecture, Serge Haroche (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2012), after illustrating Cavity QED experiments, which, besides the resonant atoms-cavity field interactions, may also provide non-resonant ones (implying non-destructive photon detection), described the corresponding experiments in Circuit QED which induce even stronger matter-light interactions, and outlined the remarkable related applications to Quantum Information. Afterwards, David J. Wineland (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2012), discussed aspects of the pioneering atomic clock, from the initial conception that the atomic energy state superpositions practically act like a pendulum clock, along with the weaknesses of the latter, to the main points of its evolution (including the mercury and aluminum ion ones), and the challenges arising from the systematic frequency shifts that affect the measurements. Theodor W. Hänsch (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2005) later discussed the way human conception of light and matter has evolved over time and the questions that still remain. From the light interference discovery to the matter-antimatter comparison experiments, precision measurements play a key role. In this context, the frequency comb is a significant tool with various applications, even in -currently challenging- precision astronomy searches. In the next lecture, William D. Phillips (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1997) described the major steps towards achieving a Bose-Einstein condensate; successive laser and evaporative cooling makes the bosonic gas cold and dense enough, preventing any \u2018ordinary\u2019 condensation. This gaseous superfluid acts as a macroscopic quantum state, and can support a (quantized) current when put into a ring trap under specific control, thus inaugurating \u2018atomtronics\u2019. Klaus von Klitzing (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1985) then showed us how his research on silicon field effect transistors finally even enhanced Quantum Metrology. The Quantum Hall and Josephson effects via their corresponding von Klitzing and Josephson constants and their introduced conventional quantum units have triggered the expected SI change: redefinition of the kilogram after \u2018fixing\u2019 the Planck constant (Watt balance/Avogadro project). Throughout the Meeting, both William D. Phillips and Klaus von Klitzing would provide us -after addressing our questions- with the 2014 CODATA wallet card of the fundamental physical constants (published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology), namely the latest updated one and at the same time last one based on the current SI of units; in 2018 SI will be revised, as clearly described in Klaus von Klitzing\u2019s lecture. Then, Gerardus \u2018t Hooft (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1999), after underlining the importance of accurate observations towards the implementation of new discoveries, described the major challenges met in the Weak force studies, and discussed the reasoning behind the proposal of the Higgs particle (strongly related to mass and spin), whose recent discovery by the LHC experiments actually constitutes a marvelous success of the accurate theoretical predictions. With Takaaki Kajita (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2015) 4th day \u2013 June 29 In the first lecture, George F. Smoot (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2006), given the two recently confirmed events of Gravitational Waves detection by LIGO from two pairs of merging black holes (announcements on 11/02/16 and 15/06/16), gave us a brief history of the main related experimental attempts, described the \u2018golden events\u2019 illustrated in the data provided by the two LIGO sites, and even demonstrated the impressive sound of the colliding black holes. Afterwards, Samuel C. Ting (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1976) described the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a precision particle physics detector on the International Space Station, which, besides the studies on the charged cosmic rays, also includes searches for the origin of Dark Matter, for Antimatter and even new phenomena, having so far provided significant results on the positron fraction and on the spectra and flux ratios of elementary particles. In the next lecture, Kurt Wüthrich (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 2002) talked about the historical background of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiment and the subsequent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) development, explaining the way the use of specific parameters can contribute to picturing particles despite their undergoing constant Brownian motion, and focused on the significant applications of this in medical diagnosis. Then, Steven Chu (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1997) outlined the way the development of new detection and imaging methods has triggered great advances in medicine and biomedical research; super-resolution imaging helps detect and prevent the pairing of the Ras molecules, nanoparticles probes allow seeing deeply into tissue, nanodiamonds injected into a developing mouse embryo (dividing together with the cells) give valuable information. The following lecture was given by Hartmut Michel (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1988) who described the biggest environmental catastrophe in Earth\u2019s history: the invention of oxygenic photosynthesis (Greatest Oxygenation Event), and proceeded outlining and comparing the ways nature coped with the general extinction threat: the developed bd and hemmer copper terminal oxidases, which removed molecular oxygen via reduction to water. Subsequently, Johann Deisenhofer (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1988) focused on the photosynthetic procedure, the chloroplast structure and the common features of three different photosynthetic systems (purple bacteria, cyanobacteria and green plants \u2013 PS I and II), using the examples of B. viridis, S. elongatus and T. vulcanus. In fact, this remarkable similarity observation may imply a single development of the photosynthetic ability on Earth. Later, Robert Huber (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1988), starting from the rise of Structural Chemistry, illustrated aspects of the now developed protein crystallography, describing thrombin as a known protease, proteasomes, and the proteolytic activity to be controlled, and outlined the nowadays significant pharmaceutical application of the Structural Biology academic research in many fields, including that of the autoimmune diseases. In the afternoon lectures session: Brian D. Josephson (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 1973) discussed how conventional Physics, aiming mainly on \u2018matter\u2019 and information processing rather than \u2018meaning\u2019, may incorporate semiotics and other perspectives met in biological systems so as to evolve overcoming the challenges; entanglement of \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018mental\u2019, and focusing more on connections/topology than on the quantitative core may reveal new potentialities of nature. Vinton G. Cerf (ACM A.M. Turing Award, 2004) then unfolded the evolution of the Internet. From the ARPANET first implementation, and the TCP/IP and WWW* invention to the future challenges of Interplanetary networks, packets, routers and protocols cooperate in a clear, layered and modular manner setting no constraints in developing applications, therefore boosting not only research and human communication, but culture in general. * more about the birth of the Web (occurred at CERN) With Vinton G. Cerf (ACM A.M. Turing Award, 2004) 5th day \u2013 June 30 The first lecture was by Stefan W. Hell (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 2014) who described the achievement of greatly improving the light microscopy resolution, by shifting the former center of research from the lens\u2019 focusing impervious barrier to the molecular states\u2019 flexible use. Stimulated emission helps separating molecules between two states (on/off), boosting the related applications in biology, material sciences, magnetic sensing, quantum information. Subsequently, Dan Shechtman (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 2011), gave us an interesting lecture about the nature of soap bubbles, which in fact reminded me of a question I had when I was little; how come oil-made soaps eliminate oil-made spots! Anyway, we were able to learn about the hydrophilic/phobic parts of the soap molecules, the micelles created when grease, soap and water meet, and the fascinating structure of the soap bubble through its color bands, turbulence and black spots observed, until gravity makes it pop. In the next lecture, Ada E. Yonath (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 2009), described the protein production mechanism in the ribosomes, whose architecture may indicate a connection to the proto-ribosome (possible \u2018source\u2019 of life), drawing the intriguing conclusion that the genetic code has likely co-evolved together with its products. Yonath also suggested some wise approach to the continuously developing antibiotic resistance of the pathogens. Martin Karplus (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 2013) then introduced us to the great issue of motion from animals to molecules, and its connection to life, separating man- and nature-made molecules, the latter being characterized by Feynman\u2019s \u2018jiggling and wiggling of atoms\u2019. Examples of the adenylate kinase and kinesin motor dynamics were illustrated and described together with the crucial linking of myoglobin to motion, and the role of ATP. Later on, Carl E. Wieman (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2001) outlined the major principles of effective science teaching and learning, given the results of several educational experiments; scientific teaching methods which allow feedback of the students\u2019 learning status, together with a mental organizational framework and learning/thinking monitoring in each individual, can make expert thinking levels attainable and thus accelerate progress in research. Afterwards, Brian Schmidt (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2011) described the main knowledge of the Universe we so far have, since its birth, 13.8 billion years ago, and the cosmology questions that still remain unanswered. The \u039b-CDM cosmological model, the composition, geometry, density of the Universe, the evidence for an accelerating expansion, the initial density fluctuations from inflation, were among the intriguing issues discussed in this lecture. The last lecture was given by Roy J. Glauber (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2005), a former scientist of the Manhattan Project, who shared his historical experience of that time in Los Alamos, through pictures showing among others Oppenheimer, von Neumann, Bethe, Bohr, Feynman, Segre, Chamberlain, following an introduction about the neutron experiments, with images picturing Fermi, Hahn, Meitner, Szilard, Bainbridge, and other prominent physicists. Right after the educational part of that day, we enjoyed the \u2018Bavarian Evening\u2019 dinner, during which we had the great chance to interact again not only with the other young scientists (many of them were dressed in their countries\u2019 traditional costumes!), but also with the Laureates; we discussed and exchanged ideas under the sound of traditional Bavarian music. With Brian Schmidt (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2011) 6th day \u2013 July 1 On the last day of this exciting \u2018journey\u2019, we had a boat trip to the beautiful Mainau island, where, in short, we attended (and participated in) a panel discussion on the future of education in sciences, and then had a Science Picnic on the Arboretum Lawn, surrounded by a stunning landscape. So that was it, regarding this exceptional experience. Back to CERN, one week now before the important 38th International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP). The Lindau Meeting has offered us a unique, astonishing, inspiration-flavored experience; I guess this is the \u2018Lindau Spirit\u2019 Countess Bettina Bernadotte (President of the Council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings) implied when introducing that term in the Opening Ceremony. All the young scientists attended the Meeting have had the great opportunity to become acquainted and interact with a group of people including both distinguished and developing scientists; I would personally be grateful to meet people from that group again in the near future, keeping this Lindau Spirit alive. Or, as the sign at the departure platform on the Mainau island said: \u2018Auf Wiedersehen\u2019!           First panel discussion          Second panel discussion             Lindavia-Brunnen fountain, close to the Stadttheater             With Martinus J. G.

McDonald (Nobel Laureate, Physics, 2015) Credits to Marta Tarkanovskaja, Philippos Papadakis, Theodoros Papanikolaou for their pictures Just some words about myself, as a first acquaintance! Well, to begin with, I am from Athens, Greece. Despite the fact that my interest in Physics already started in an early form at a very young age, I pursued my undergraduate studies at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), since computer programming was my second major field of interest. Nevertheless, even within my engineering studies, I was given the opportunity not only to broaden my knowledge on Physics by attending various Mechanics/Electromagnetism classes, but also to work in depth on several modern physics problems. Both finally acted as a catalyst for this science to hold even greater academic interest for me. At the same time, the Computer Software/Hardware/Networks courses I attended helped me build a  Computer Science background, as well. I then attended the MSc program in Nuclear and Elementary Particle Physics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), which consolidated my scientific interest in Physics, and established Particle Physics as my major academic direction. My Master\u2019s Thesis on searches for Supersymmetry gave me the opportunity to work on recent problems in experimental High Energy Physics, in the search for phenomena which experimentally prove the existence of Physics beyond the Standard Model. In this thesis, the Supersymmetry indication possibility in areas of compressed mass spectra is studied, in a search which is based on the combined information from the data collected by the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, and from their Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, the efficiency of the choice criteria of the High Level Trigger at the new higher center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is studied, with the aim to optimize the analysis at the current data collection period at the LHC. Fig 1 : Large Hadron Collider at CERN To sum up, the undergraduate studies at the Technical University provided me with a combination of mathematical and technical skills which would have allowed going on in multiple scientific directions. And also the MSc studies at the Physics Department offered me the necessary academic supplies to build up my abilities in physics and supported my initial inclination towards this subject, leading me finally to pursue the direction of experimental High Energy Physics. I currently have the honour of having been assigned the ESR position within the \u201cMarie Sklodowska-Curie Actions\u201d Innovative Training Network AMVA4NewPhysics, at CERN, in the Experimental Physics Department of the CMS experiment at the LHC, whilst working towards my PhD. This position contains the chance of gaining knowledge on Supersymmetry/Dark Matter searches combined with getting trained in the use of various MultiVariate Analysis methods. Without a doubt, the above constitutes a unique, multi-sided opportunity for a young scientist, providing a wide range of research and training benefits throughout the corresponding programme, which by the way includes both academic and non-academic parts. I would be really glad to share with every one of you, the enthusiastic readers of this blog, the basic steps taken during this whole procedure, and especially keep you updated on the highlights encountered throughout this exciting journey! So, see you soon! Fig 2 : A small fraction of the CMS Collaboration together with a 1:1 scale photograph of the CMS detector, inside Building 40 Figures taken from http://cms.web.cern.ch Maria Sk\u0142odowska was born on November 7th, 1867 in Warsaw, Poland (in the part then dominated by the Russian Empire). Being brought up in a family of teachers, Maria quickly grew interest in acquiring higher education; this was initially and partly achieved through attending Warsaw\u2019s local schools, but also within her own family environment, receiving some scientific training from her father. She was unable to enrol in a regular higher education institute due to her being a woman, and, after becoming involved in a Polish students\u2019 revolutionary organization that defended equal education opportunities against the then status, she left for Cracow, which was under Austrian rule at the time. The high barriers in accessing education and at the same time the low financial resources in her family, which inevitably restricted any plans for studying abroad, seemed to create insuperable obstacles to pursuing a career in science. Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie However, in 1891, and after working for a few years as a tutor and governess to gather the necessary funds, Maria Sk\u0142odowska was eventually able to move from Poland to Paris, France, in order to obtain higher education, continuing her studies at the Sorbonne; there, she was initially investigating the magnetic properties of steels. In 1894, she met Pierre Curie, who would soon become her major scientific collaborator and one year later her husband. Pierre was a Professor at the School of Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne, and Marie \u2013 after earning two Physics degrees \u2013 was already pursuing her Ph.D. In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovers the existence of X-rays, and, in 1896, Henri Becquerel discovers that uranium salts emit rays that resemble the X-rays. Inspired by these interesting ongoing studies, Maria saw in the uranium rays\u2019 investigation a candidate research topic for her thesis. Pierre and Marie Curie\u2019s early research was often performed under difficult laboratory conditions, due to lack of dedicated facilities and also due to their meagre resources, which alone made them undertake much teaching to financially support their family. What\u2019s more, their being obviously unaware of the radiation exposure hazards, the continuous work with radioactive materials without any protective equipment was fatally endangering their own health. After Marie\u2019s studies on uranium minerals, in 1898, Marie and Pierre announced the discovery of \u201cpolonium\u201d \u2013 named after Marie\u2019s country of birth \u2013 and short afterwards the discovery of \u201cradium\u201d. They aimed at isolating both elements, to firmly prove their existence. In the course of their research, they also coined the word \u201cradioactivity\u201d.   Pierre and Marie Curie in the laboratory   In 1900, Marie Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure. In 1903, she got her doctorate, and a few months later, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, \u201cin recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel\u201d. In 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in an accident. The couple had been raising two daughters, Irène and Ève. Soon after Pierre\u2019s death, the Physics department of the Sorbonne decided to retain the chair that had been created for him and to offer it to Marie; she was the first woman to become a professor at the Sorbonne. In 1910, Marie Curie succeeded in isolating radium. She also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named after her and Pierre: the Curie. As her pioneering research on radioactivity was continuously being recognised, in 1911 Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \u201cin recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\u201d. During World War I, Curie\u2019s contribution was remarkable; after developing mobile radiography units with X-ray equipment intended for assisting battlefield doctors towards promptly treating the wounded soldiers, she became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France\u2019s first military radiology centre. On July 4th, 1934 Marie Curie died from aplastic anaemia; this is believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation. Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie statue facing the Radium Institute in Warsaw, Poland The significant scientific milestones mentioned above are only an indicative subset of Marie Curie\u2019s achievements in Physics and Chemistry and of her overall outstanding contribution to science and humanity. The same holds for the awards and honorary degrees she has received. It is besides worth mentioning that Marie and Pierre often refused awards and medals, which at the same time shows not only their modesty but also their unswerving focus on their work, regardless of the attaining recognition. Moreover, despite the overwhelming financial difficulties Marie Curie faced as a student and also for many years at the early stages of her research, she managed to succeed, setting a hopeful example for her students and scientists that followed, who battled against similar issues. What\u2019s more, even after her work obtained recognition, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium isolation process, so that the scientific community could do related research unhindered. In addition and in another direction, she managed to succeed, despite also the gender inequality barriers she faced in both her native and her adoptive country and all throughout her scientific career (even after her success, she continued to face great opposition from male scientists, and never received significant financial benefits from her work). In this way, a new era at both scientific and societal levels was undeniably just inaugurated; her profound impact on science starting over a century ago eventually questioned the then existing state of extreme imbalance between the male and female researchers\u2019 number involved in science, directly resulting in raising diversity issues, and therefore paving the way for all women to follow a career in science. As a result, still and, maybe even more, nowadays that there remains the seek for more motivation and equality, her presence constitutes an incredibly inspirational example to follow for all scientists, and certainly especially for women. The Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) fellowship programme of the European Union is named after her, as a tribute to the remarkable imprint she has left in science. And AMVA4NewPhysics, which is a Research Network within MSCA, carries as such the inspiration of an eminent scientist and infuses to its Fellows the overall strong motivation that this implies. A few days ago, on the Marie Curie Day 2017, November 7th, for the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, a Multi-Site event coordinated by the University of Liverpool took place in 3 cities: Liverpool, Geneva (CERN), and Munich (LMU), hosting live streaming talks among all three locations and also having a special local programme in each one. At CERN, where Cécile Granier was the organizer of the interesting local event, the programme started with a poster session, in which research results and career paths of past and current MSCA Fellows were presented, and during which all of us were able to meet with each other and exchange ideas on our studies and experience within the MSCA fellowship. But after this session, and through the talks by Dr. Marco Silari (CERN) and Prof. Carsten P. Welsch (University of Liverpool), we had the chance to get an even more thorough picture of the MSCA research grants and of the way these manage to build an ideal framework for research and training, setting a strong career basis for their Fellows; the interdisciplinary mix of research fields and the cutting edge training opportunities they provide, the fruitful cooperation with various teams in an  international dimension \u2013 which is feasible through the mobility that is encouraged (inspired by Marie Curie\u2019s own life and career path), and even the complementary skills the Fellows can gain and the outreach activities they are involved in, compose a driver for pioneering motivation and research excellence, honouring in this way the legacy and enlivening the work of one of the most influential scientists ever existed.                                                                                 Poster Session at CERN on Marie Curie Day 2017 (Many thanks to Cécile Granier for organising the event and providing this material!) Nobel Prize Facts Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, one of two women (out of a total of 198 individuals) to win a Nobel Prize in Physics (the other is Maria Goeppert-Mayer), the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and part of the family that has received the most Nobel Prizes, with four Prizes awarded to five individual laureates: Marie Curie received the Prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, Pierre Curie shared the 1903 Physics Prize with her. Their daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband, Frédéric Joliot-Curie (their daughter, granddaughter of Pierre and Marie Curie, Hélène Langevin-Joliot, a physicist herself, and now the emeritus research director in fundamental nuclear physics at the CNRS in Orsay, France, gave recently a lecture at CERN). In addition, Henry Labouisse, the husband of Marie Curie\u2019s second daughter, Ève, was the director of UNICEF when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965.   First of all, Happy New Year to everyone; my best wishes for a healthy, happy and productive 2017! Let\u2019s hope Particle Physics has in store for us some intriguing stuff in its New Year\u2019s resolutions, and is -of course- consistent enough in keeping them! [this time] The same should hold for Machine Learning, which however has already offered us some very powerful moments in 2016. For me, the two most astonishing and longed-for/ beyond expectations achievements of 2016, science-wise, would be: 1) The double detection of gravitational waves, those impressive ripples in the fabric of space-time propagating at the speed of light, from two pairs of merging black holes; for both, the public announcements were made by LIGO in 2016 (11/02/16 and 15/06/16), and corresponded to observations occurred in 2015 (14/09/15 and 26/12/15, respectively). That proof of Einstein\u2019s audacious prediction has -without a doubt- constituted a perfect celebration of the centenary of General Relativity. 2) The victory of Google\u2019s AlphaGo [computer program] over the 18-time Go world champion, Lee Sedol [9 dan ranked human] on a Go match in March 2016 (5-game final score: 4-1). That is supposed to be a much earlier than expected Artificial Intelligence success, in a game considered to require a general-purpose and intuitive winning strategy, compared to chess or other board games, which makes it extremely hard for a computer algorithm to prevail, defeating human intelligence. Therefore, in science and research, 2016 ended with this wonderful breakthrough progress. But it also ended with a wonderful -mutatis mutandis- meeting of the AMVA Network in Oxford on 19-20/12/16, where its PhD students had the opportunity to present and discuss their own progress up to now, whilst holding their ESR positions. Very briefly*, Cecilia described her work on the di-Higgs events, Alessia discussed her project on the use of the MoMEMta tool (Matrix Element Method), Alex presented his studies on the ttH(bb) channel, Pablo talked about his work on the HH(4b) channel, Greg described his project on statistical models, I presented my studies on Deep Learning in HEP, and Giles talked about his work on the di-Higgs events. But apart from the academic side of the meeting, in terms of which we had the opportunity to attend the very interesting presentations of the other ESRs, ask questions on their projects, learn from their answers, and exchange ideas and tips for our work, this meeting was also a great chance for all the Network  group to gather and interact. Slightly before Christmas, we got to spend some time with our supervisors and other members of the Network, discussing our near-future plans and forthcoming secondments, and sharing thoughts on our studies and overall progress. It was a great way of getting more motivated to set higher standards for our work, upon stronger collaboration among us and mutual support. As Alessia also pointed out in her latest post, for some of us, this year\u2019s start signifies the beginning of our secondment periods. Pablo and I will be heading to California in a few weeks, and will be keeping the blog updated with our west\u2014side research news. But before that, we will both have the chance to meet again with the other ESRs in Padova, Italy, for a Network\u2019s workshop (I guess more related details will be shortly out on the blog) in the very beginning of February, so as to get even more of the valuable training (and interaction opportunities) this Network provides. So see you all, soon! [a bit sooner than before :)] *All ESRs are currently having some work in progress, parts of which may have already been and/or will (continue to) be discussed over our blog posts; I guess the latter ones shall contain a more clear and accurate summary, driven by the specific way each one of us would prefer presenting it. I am therefore giving here just a rough outline. PS: Many thanks to Tommaso Dorigo and Daniela Bortoletto for organising this wonderful Oxford Meeting!
