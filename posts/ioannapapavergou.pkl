V One of the best parts of being a physics PhD student is having the chance to broaden your knowledge by attending seminars and schools especially designed for helping you to be more efficient in your research. I was fortunate to have such an opportunity by attending the first CMS Physics Object School (POS) which took place from September 4th to 8th in Bari, Italy. The school was organized by the Physics Department of the University of Bari and INFN and its aim was to help new CMS members to become familiar with the reconstructed physics objects and the detector\u2019s performance, so that they can contribute effectively to the Physics Object Groups (POG) and the Data Performance Groups (DPG) of CMS. Before attending the school we had to complete a set of pre-exercises, in order to have everything set-up and be ready to participate in the short and long exercises which would take place during the school. Personally, I found the set of the pre-exercises very helpful, as I got introduced to the CMS software (CMSSW), I set up my CRAB certificate and submitted my first jobs on CRAB. I also had the chance to learn about the Data aggregation system (DAS) and the Event Data Model (EDM) framework utilities. The school\u2019s schedule was an intense one-week course that consisted of several talks on the first day, two short exercises on different physics objects and one long exercise which would be presented in the context of a competition between the groups on the final day of the school. The talks of the first day were focused on the motivation of the organizers to deliver such an event and the importance of training the new CMS members so that they can contribute to the physics analyses within the collaboration. Adbelhak Djouadi gave a theoretical talk on the motivation of the New Physics searches via searches of the H/W/Z/top sector and also through new particle searches with more data. The rest of the first morning\u2019s talks were focused on more technical topics, such as the talk of Lucia Silvestris on running the CMS detector, the talk of Gurpreet Singh Chanal on the physics performance and datasets and Marcellos Abbrescia\u2019s talk on the CMS upgrade. After lunch the short-exercise session started. The exercises were focused on the data performance of the different detector parts (DT, ECAL, HCAL, RPC, tracker) and there was also a group that would work on the physics performance and dataset. I decided to follow this last exercise, facilitated by Gurpreet Singh Chanal. In the beginning of the session there was a short tutorial on the need of the MC production and how to use DAS and McM to find details of the samples. During the exercise time, we used a miniAOD file and learned how to look it up on DAS, find all the details (global tags, CMSSW release, etc.) and then look for it on McM. We further found the LHE, GEN-SIM and DIGI-Reco used to produced the miniAOD. We looked for the details on the x-section cuts on the generator level and the global tags in GEN-SIM and after we got familiar with using the McM we were asked to use the cmsdrivers and produce the LHE, GEN-SIM and DIGI-RECO requests that were used to produce a specific miniAOD file. As for my second short exercise, I decided to follow the group of Drift Tubes (DT)/Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) timing measurement, facilitated by Piotr Traczyk. The muon time measurement is important in order to determine the muon bunch crossing. The exercise was organized in three parts. In the first one we had to read the DT and CSC segments from the Event and write an ntuple containing the info of timing and the number of hits, while in the second part of the exercise we matched the segments to muons using the MuonSegmentMatcher method by looping over muons of the event and looking at segments attached to them. In the last part of the exercise we played around with the produced ntuples by applying ID or kinematic cuts and studying the behavior of the timing under these restrictions. It was already Tuesday evening and it was time to move on to the long exercise. I chose to follow the muon exercise as its content was fully aligned with my work both on the SUSY analysis, but also on my service work on the L1 muon trigger. The muon exercise was facilitated by Daniele Trocino who had prepared a very detailed and well organized two-and-a-half-days program of tutorials and exercises. In the beginning of the session we had an introduction on the muon object and its reconstruction in the CMS detector. As a first exercise we used the pat::Muon (reco) objects and extracted its main kinematic variables. We furtherÂ matched the reconstructed to generator level and trigger objects by imposing geometrical matching criteria. In the second part of the exercise we worked on muon identification by exploiting the main properties and quality variables of the muon tracks, such as the type of muon (global, tracker etc.), the number of hits in the muon chambers, the impact parameter, and others. These variables exhibit different behavior for muons coming from different sources (prompt, heavy flavor decay, light flavor decay, fakes) and thus we can use the distribution of these variables to distinguish between the different muon sources. In the next step of the exercise we worked on the muon momentum scale. Distortions in the measurements of the muon momentum can be produced by an imperfect knowledge of the position and alignment of the tracker layers and the muon chamber, or the poor knowledge of the components and distribution of the material and the magnetic field configuration in the detector. We can thus use muon momentum calibration algorithms like Rochester, which use constraints on the mass of well known resonances (Z, J/\u010eˆ) in order to correct for the muon momentum. Finally, the last step of the muon long exercise was focused on efficiency calculation using the Tag-And-Probe method, which utilizes well known resonances like Z that decays into two muons. We computed the MC-truth efficiencies by using a generator level muon in the acceptance region (pt > 20GeV, |Î\u02c7| < 2.4), matching reconstructed to generator level muons, and filling histograms with generator level particles at different selection stages. The efficiencies were calculated from the ratio of the initial generator level muons when no selection cuts were imposed and the generator level particles after the selection cuts. We further calculated the efficiency using the Tag-And-Probe method on the reco muons and imposing kinematic cuts on the pt, Î\u02c7, isolation and single muon trigger cuts to select the tag muon. The probe was selected so that the tag and the probe muons are within a narrow window around the Z mass and are of opposite sign. If the probe was identified as a full muon it was set to be a passing muon and the efficiency could be calculated by dividing the number of probes by the number of passing probes. After the end of the long exercise, all the physics object groups prepared a 15 minute talk in which they presented their work. Even though all the groups did an excellent job, the tau group won the competition and received the prize of a good luck charm from the region of Puglia. However, we all toasted and celebrated after the end of the presentations. The Physics Object School in Bari was an amazing experience in every sense. We followed talks and tutorials fully related to our work, but we also got help on solving problems and using the CMS software for our analysis from the experts. Moreover, it was a great chance to meet other young people, also new to CMS, with whom we share the same interests but also the same struggles. I think that it was a great opportunity for networking, improving computing skills, making some new friends, but also enjoying the good weather and amazing food of the Italian south. I fully recommend to all the CMS newcomers to attend the next CMS Physics Object School. Until next time, arrivederci \u0111Ÿ™‚ Group photo of the participants on the first POS school in Bari, September 2017 Hi there! As this is my first post at the blog let me introduce myself. My name is Ioanna Papavergou and I am the new ESR of the AMVA4NewPhysics selected for the position at IASA in Athens. I was born and raised in Kavala, a small city by the sea located in the northern part of Greece. Physics was my passion since high school and so there was no other option to me than studying Physics during my undergrad studies, getting my Bachelor degree from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. During thelast couple of years of my studies I focused on nuclear physics and elementary particle courses together with some courses on astroparticle physics. It was then when I realised I am interested in the interface of particle physics and astrophysics and thus I studied the effect of nuclear physics on the emission of gravitational waves from neutron stars during my bachelor research project. Since I was passionate about both particle and stars I couldn\u2019t make up my mind on which path I should follow and so I combined the two by following a very special Master course in Gravitation and Astroparticle Physics at the University of Amsterdam (GRAPPA). The research at the GRAPPA institute focuses at the intersection of theoretical particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology addressing questions such as what is the nature of Dark Matter, what is the origin and the acceleration mechanism of the cosmic rays, what is gravity and many more\u2026 Apparently, the master course at the GRAPPA institute seemed the perfect choice for me, combing courses in theory and data analysis but also giving me the opportunity to spend two years in one of the most beautiful, interesting and international cities in Europe!! The nature and the properties of the elusive component of our Universe which comprises the 26.5\u005c% of the total energy budget of our Universe intrigued me the most. Moreover, I was interested in using observations of the motions of the stars, called astrometrics, in order to get an insight into the dark matter distribution. During my master thesis project I used the stellar kinematics of a small group of stars located in the solar vicinity in order to measure the local dark matter density. I was honoured to have Dr. Gianfranco Bertone as my master thesis supervisor but also as my mentor. Gianfranco helped me deal with the very technical problem of astrometrics but also provided important advice regarding my next carrier steps. I was interested in measuring the local dark matter density in the solar vicinity as it is an important input parameter for both direct and indirect dark matter detection searches. An accurate determination of the local dark matter density is crucial for the scans of the theoretical parameter space of the dark matter. With the advent of the GAIA astrometric data we will be able to get a better constraint value of the local dark matter density, discarding assumptions entering our analysis method and using more accurate measurements of the motions of the stars.

Brighter regions indicate regions where the concentration of stars is denser. The GAIA satellite Although I really enjoyed studied astroparticle physics, cosmology and astrometrics I am always curious in learning and working in new-to-me fields of physics. I believe that in this way I will be able to have a more well-rounded knowledge of physics. Moreover, the ESR position at IASA is offering a rich training program at international schools, workshops and conferences and also participation in the research program of AMVA4NewPhysics in searches for superpsymmetry and dark matter physics. All these reasons motivated me to apply for the ESR position at IASA and here I am !! I am very excited for my new start in the field of experimental High Energy Physics and data analysis. I am really looking forward to meet every one of you and be part of the group. Hope to see you all soon \u0111Ÿ™‚ It has already been almost 2 months since I arrived at CERN, but it certainly feels like a week. Being in such an interesting place, surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world, is a unique and inspiring feeling for a young researcher like myself. I was also lucky enough to be able to have the opportunity to visit CERN in the beginning of my PhD, which greatly helped me to integrate to the CMS experiment. No later than during my first week here I came to realize the importance of group meetings for the scientific community at CERN. All kind of meetings are taking place every day of the week and people from all around the world can listen and contribute by giving updates on their research. Even though I was a bit dissapointed after the first few meetings, because I could\u2019t understand most of the jargon people where using, I soon started to grow fond of following and even giving regular reports about my work to the rest of the group. The weekly meetings and private communication with the group members helped me a lot to start feeling as a member of the group. However, I was still missing some basic knowledge concerning the experiment and the collaboration. Thankfully, CMS helped all its new members to get an idea if the collaboration administration, the details of the detector and the techniques used in the experiment, by providing an introductory course during the second week of June (so right on time!). It was a 2-day course and the agenda foresaw overview talks on various topics and a visit to point 5. During the talks of the first day we heard about the LHC and the CMS detector and more specifically about the muon tracking system, the calorimeters and some details concerning the detector\u2019s assembly. Later on there were talks on data taking, the offline preparation and data analysis, which provided very useful information for someone like me, who is just starting their first analysis. The day ended with talks from people of the CMS community group, the collaboration board and the young scientist community, followed by a very informative talk about \u201cpracticalities\u201d at CMS. This last talk of the day not only provided general info about useful web pages, indico and twiki pages, but also focused on the requirements and responsibilities of CMS members. The speaker emphasized the importance and adviced the new members of the collaboration to keep following their goals and manage their time in such a way that they are maximally efficient, but to also find a good balance between life and work. Unfortunately, we were not able to visit the detector on the second day, since the experiment was running, but we got a nice tour on the surface site, followed by talks on the safety at CERN. The introductory course ended with a seminar on the operation monitoring system, the L1 trigger online control system, and an overview on physics performance and data set operations. Overall, the course was a great way for me to start my stay at CERN, my membership in the collaboration, and my work on the L1 muon trigger DPG group and on the SUSY analysis, which I will talk about in an upcoming post.
