V These the words of Fernando Ferroni, president at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) in Italy, on occasion of his talk at the 7th International School of Science Journalism in Erice this week. Together with other 40 fellows I had the great pleasure to attend this school around the theme \u201cFundamental Science: From cutting edge technologies to the heart of society\u201d. The view from the room where we had our coffee breaks. The school, organised by Science Writers in Italy, INFN Frascati, and Centro Fermi, brings together scientists and science communicators, with the latter ranging from staff at press offices and science centers to science journalists. The scientific talks this year had a stress on fundamental and applied particle physics and of course also gravitational waves were present. Amongst the speakers were Eugenio Coccia, Marco Durante, Alessandro Variola and, as already said, Fernando Ferroni. The talks about communication covered practical subjects, like the very inspiring \u201cPlanning a reportage\u201d by Jacopo Pasotti, the preparation and implementation of an exhibition about the life of Enrico Fermi (Rosario Nania), the experience of Anna Maria Zaccheddu who works in communications at Telethon, a biomedical charity, and the fascinating story about embargoes, leaks and international agreements between the first detection of gravitational waves in September 2015 until they were finally announced in February 2016, told by Eleonora Cossi. Other lectures were meant to provide sparks for exchange and discussion, like Fred Balvert\u2019s \u201cMind the gap in science communication\u201d and Joost Van Kasteren\u2019s \u201cScience Policy\u201d. Especially the latter provoked a very heated discussion between scientists and communicators that originated in the presentation of an article by John P.A. Ioannidis from 2005: \u201cWhy most published research findings are false\u201d. Also the interview with Fernando Ferroni by Claudia Di Giorgio lead to a fiery exchange and showed clearly that communication and understanding between scientists and communicators still has a long way ahead before we will all be on common grounds when it comes to engaging the public. Statements like \u201cThese things are impossible to communicate, they are too difficult\u201d clearly show the need for exchange and collaboration! Among my personal favourites were the interactive sessions, where all fellows were involved. In small groups we had to work on assignments, with time pressing and the need to be creative, thorough and collaborative with people you barely knew. In the first group session we were asked to prepare a press conference, activity for kids or presentation for stakeholders starting from a short article about some scientific results. The second one was even more challenging for me: prepare a pitch for an article for a science magazine on a subject touched during the school. Another highlight was the talk by Mohammed Yahia \u201cCovering science in the middle east\u201d. It introduced me to a completely new world that I didn\u2019t even know existed. Or did you know that Saudi Arabia\u2019s science output is comparable to many western countries? Also the session about science communication in different parts of the world was great. The organisers exploited that fact that we were 40 people from 20 different countries in the whole world and asked six of the fellows to present the way science is communicated in their country. It was very interesting to see the differences between Russia, Egypt, Rumania, Japan, Argentina and Israel. Each country has its own strategies, challenges and methods and we can only learn from each other! Science communicators and journalists from Russia, Egypt, Rumania, Japan, Argentina, and Israel. But the very best thing was the possibility to meet other people that work in many different fields of science communication. We had ample time to exchange and discuss in the beautiful surroundings of the Erice summer and lots of new ideas and connections were born and will be intensified in the coming weeks and months. You see, it was a very interesting and inspiring week and even though I am back home now, it will be work of the upcoming weeks to review the experience and to put into practice some of the new ideas. I want to leave you with the picture of a slide by Mohammed Yahia which expresses both the spirit of the school and something that I am ever more convinced of: \u201cThe best years of all my life\u201d. This is how Galileo Galilei felt about the time he spent in Padova between 1592 and 1610. In his years as a professor of mathematics at the University of Padua he not only worked on the development of the scientific method, but also wrote two of his famous works, \u201cSidereus Nuncius\u201d and \u201cDialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo\u201d (Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, published later in Florence). You see, there is quite some scientific heritage in Padova. And this holds not only for these early beginnings, but also for later years. Bruno Rossi and his attempts to solve the cosmic ray mystery is just another example. It is no surprise then that in 1951 Padova was one of the four founders of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics, created to uphold and develop the scientific tradition established during the 1930s by Enrico Fermi and his school, with their theoretical and experimental research in nuclear physics. In the second half of the 1950s, the INFN designed and built the first Italian accelerator, the electron synchrotron developed in Frascati, where its first national laboratory was set up. During the same period, the INFN began to participate in studies conducted by CERN in Geneva aimed at constructing ever-more powerful accelerators. Location of the INFN\u2019s 20 units (blue) and 4 laboratories (red). Today, the institute, which has its main headquarters at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, conducts theoretical and experimental research in the fields of subnuclear, nuclear and astroparticle physics. The INFN counts about 1800 staff members, 500 young researchers (short-term contracts, PhD students, post-docs) and 3500 associated members who work in the 20 units and 4 laboratories all over Italy. All of the INFN\u2019s research activities are undertaken within a framework of international competition, in close collaboration with Italian universities on the basis of solid academic partnerships spanning decades. The main building of the Physics and Astronomy Department \u201cGalileo Galilei\u201d of the University of Padua. The Padova unit of the INFN is hosted in the Physics and Astronomy Department \u201cGalileo Galilei\u201d of the University of Padova, sharing all facilities with the department. The main department is a 3-story building with offices, seminar rooms and several laboratories. The Department also hosts the Museum of the History of Physics, which is definitely worth a visit if you ever come to Padova! Amongst PhD students, post-docs and senior scientists, there are about 40 researchers in Padua, both from the INFN and the university, that are involved in the CMS experiment at LHC.  During the beginnings of the experiment, the Padova group strongly contributed to the construction of CMS\u2019 muon drift chambers and the tracker. At the moment, a part of the group works on upgrades of these hardware components. Other researchers focus on the analysis of the data: studies of b-physics, dark-matter searches, di-boson and di-Higgs searches, and the search for same-sign leptons.  And, since September last year, one of the CMS members in Padua, Tommaso Dorigo, is also the coordinator of the AMVA4NewPhysics network! With him, three other CMS researchers, Paolo Checchia, Franco Simonetto and Martino Dall\u2019Osso, joined the network. And of course, let\u2019s not forget about Padova\u2019s ESR, Pablo De Castro! Together they work on the development of multi-variate analysis methods for the study of non-resonant Higgs-boson pairs.  \u201cAnd Padova itself?\u201d you might ask, \u201cwhat is life in Padova like?\u201d. Well, I have to say: \u201cIt is just great!\u201d Since I have moved here more than five years ago I have simply fallen in love with this city. Imagine one of those typical Italian cities with its huge market places, small and curvy streets and historic buildings. There you go, this is the lovely Padua!                          It is not very big with its roughly 200.000 inhabitants and the preferred means of transportation is the bike. The more than 60.000 university students that populate Padova make sure that there is always something to do, last but not least, Padova is the home of Spritz. What, you don\u2019t know what that is? Then come see us and we will help you find out!
