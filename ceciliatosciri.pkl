V Hi there! I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been in touch over the last few weeks, but this summer has been really crazy for me! After the dissertation of my master thesis, I had just one day to pack everything, all my emotions, my memories, fears, hopes and dreams and go for this new amazing Ph.D. experience! It was the first day of June and from that moment on, I got around so much that my mother, as a travel agency owner, should be proud of her daughter :)! Just to give you an idea: during the last three months I have moved to 10 different accommodations, worked at 7 different desks, taken 5 flights and 4 trains, attended more than 10 working lunches and dinners, shaken about two hundreds hands and met even more people!†So I hope you can forgive me that†I\u2019ve been neglecting my duties as a blogger, but I promise I will improve, I just needed to get used to this new lifestyle! Now, let me tell you where this adventure has gotten me. CERN (part 1) First of all I went to CERN to start my training with the ATLAS experiment. After the first few days filled with annoying paperwork issues, I met the relevant people of the Flavour Tagging ATLAS group to discuss some hypothetical qualification task to work on. Indeed, the policy of authorship of ATLAS is based on the principle that an ATLAS author should have made significant contribution to the experiment. To qualify as an author a person must have been an ATLAS member for at least one year and have spent a significant (specified) amount of their available research time doing ATLAS technical work. Since an aspiring author has to work hard for the collaboration, it is more advisable to work†on a project strictly connected to their†research analysis, in order to optimize both time and work. In my case, since I\u2019m going to work on Higgs decays to bottom quark pairs for my Ph.D., I would like to be involved in a qualification project strictly connected to b-jets. But not always the experiment requirements match your needs, and finally they proposed me some tasks regarding light flavor jet calibration, very interesting but quite off-topic! I have started to look at some papers and to prepare myself to work on this new task. In this period I also attended a Machine Learning workshop (https://indico.cern.ch/event/525023/overview†). Even if the course was not so basic (it was my very first approach to this field), it has shown†to be useful to introduce myself to this promising discipline. LUND Machine Learning is a subject of main interest for me and people involved in the AMVA4NP network, since the aim of the project is developing advanced statistical learning tools for applications to particle physics problems. So, at the end of June, I also attended the Machine Learning School in Lund (Sweden) that you already heard about from Giles and Pablo. I really appreciated the school and began to understand the potentiality of that discipline! But you already know what happened in Lund, so let\u2019s move on! OXFORD Then I moved to Oxford for one month. I told you something about Oxford in my previous post. I will spend more words about living in that city in the future, when I will settle down and I will become more familiar with it (this time I felt just like a visitor)! However, the time spent in Oxford has been really enjoyable, especially because of Giles\u2019 and Alessia\u2019s secondments. We worked really well together, producing†the Monte Carlo samples for the process pp\u2192 hh\u2192 4b and for the main QCD backgrounds related to the process of interest. These samples represent a good starting point for our next studies. CERN (part 2) When I was in Oxford a new possible qualification task connected with b-jet physics was proposed by the Jet Energy Scale (JES) and Jet Energy Resolution (JER) group. It consists in exploring the jet energy resolution for b-jets. Currently, the jet resolution provider in ATLAS doesn\u2019t take into account flavor differences, but the resolution of b-jets could be quite different because of semileptonic decays. I accepted the proposal and I travelled†again to CERN in order to meet and work with the relevant experts of the JES/JER group. So, I spent another two weeks at CERN. This second time at CERN left me a better impression than the previous one. I have†to say that the first time I still had the green of Fermilab\u2019s prairies in my eyes (do you remember my first post?) and the comparison with the impersonal buildings at CERN was natural. Instead, after some time, I began†to feel a melancholic atmosphere along the†vintage†corridors inside the buildings. It reminds me of the time when I was a child and sometimes, on Saturday morning, my sister and I went†to visit my father in his office with its long corridor with carpeting on the floor. It seems that something magnificent is about to happen! And, of course, the number of people that you can meet in the main area in front of the restaurant (R1) is innumerable! This is one of the best aspects of this place, the CERN community itself! Besides work, I also participated in†the guided tour of CERN. This kind of tours, organized by CERN, is†addressed to a general public (not physicists) and I found it quite boring! I would be of†this opinion even if I was not a physicist! I mean, the information was interesting and well explained, but I think that a CERN tour should be spectacular and astonishing, like the CERN itself! Just the final step of the tour was really amazing. CERN\u2019s first accelerator, a 600 MeV synchrocyclotron built in 1957, in the flesh! It is shown with a wonderful game of lights that make it look as if it was†alive! If you happen to stop by CERN and you want to see it, you can book your guided tour at this link,†but consider that, due to limited capacity and high demand, you have few chances to reserve your tour (they open reservation just for one day, 15 days before). Good luck! ROME and PISA At that point I deserved some vacation, so I spent a couple of weeks in a beautiful country, where the sun is shining and the food is fantastic! Obviously, †I\u2019m talking about Italy, but I\u2019ll tell you more details in my next post! PADOVA Actually, I\u2019m still in Italy, even if the holiday is over! I arrived in Padova for my secondment a few days ago! I\u2019m waiting for the other AMVA4NP ESRs Giles, Greg and Pablo to start working together. This is more or less the lifestyle of a young physicist. It\u2019s exiting and very stimulating! But it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows! Sometimes you feel alone even among hundreds of people and you can miss significant moments of your family. But, as my sweet Grandma used to say:†c\u2019est la vie! Many†people, especially Italian people, like to complain about the weather in the United Kingdom and endorse other stereotypes, as†the bad food, the expensive living, the excessive politeness of British people, the lack of the use of†bidet\u2026 Well, that\u2019s all true! During the last three weeks in Oxford I\u2019ve rarely seen a sunny day. Or actually, it happens to me that when I wake up in the morning I can see a weak ray of sunshine across the window and every day I think \u201cwell, today is the day, summer is coming!\u201d and I head for the Department of Physics, leaving my jacket at home. But magically, when I get off the bus, the sky suddenly becomes gloomy and it looks like autumn! Ok, no problem, autumn is my favorite season, once you know that summer simply doesn\u2019t exist here, you act accordingly! But the lack of summer has an impact on the food too: how do vegetables grow without sun? Indeed, you can not find many varieties of fruits and vegetables in the supermarkets, and the few that you manage to encounter are just flavourless. Sorry, but the topic of food is the one that matters most to Italian people. We are used to having amazing meals of lasagne, pizza, pasta, any kind of ham and cheese, fresh fruit and vegetables, and these are just the common examples. The point is that we can not believe that \u201cfish and chips\u201d could be a national dish! On the other hand, if you are an Italian abroad, you can easily play a special role in some events. For instance, yesterday I was invited to participate in a barbecue (starting at 4 p.m.! Was that lunch or dinner?) where basically I didn\u2019t know anyone and I showed up with a homemade tiramis˘. It was a total†success, and I\u2019m sure that, even if they will not remember my name, at least they will think about my cake for several days! Concerning British people, they have an extremely polite behaviour, they continuously apologise for everything and they don\u2019t miss a \u201cplease\u201d! I mean, this is not a bad thing at all, but sometimes you really don\u2019t understand what they are actually thinking and you start suspecting†that they are secretly judging or making fun of you! I\u2019m stopping now, I could continue talking about the importance of the bidet in a civilized society, but I fear†that not many people would understand (to my disappointment, this mysterious object has taken root only in Italy and in few other places in the world). You could think now that I am too much disapproving, but I want to recall that I come from Tuscany and people from there are famous for their sharp sarcasm, not as polite as the english humor! I know, that\u2019s no excuse, but to each his own, right? Well, seriously speaking, actually I am very happy of my life†in Oxford.†Everything in this city smells like history and culture to explore. It is a bustling cosmopolitan town, plenty of historic buildings, colleges, libraries and museums. I adore the architecture of the houses with the typical sloped roof. And, among all, I\u2019m going to study and work for a while in one of the most ancient and prestigious universities in the world! I can not hide that this is really exciting and motivating! Give me more time and I will get used to the afternoon tea, the porridge and the cars driving in the wrong direction! After all, a perfect country does not exist! Hey there! My name is Cecilia Tosciri, I am the ESR of the AMVA4NewPhysics network selected for the position at the University of Oxford. Since you will hear from me and my work for a while, let me introduce myself and explain how I ended up in this exciting project. I graduated one month ago at the University of Pisa (Italy), the city where I was born and raised. I\u2019ve always been a very curious person. When I was a child I started to understand that the human brain is the most powerful tool in our hands and I decided to use it in the best way possible. I started to think a lot about life in a philosophical, religious and sentimental way but it seemed to me that nothing could give comprehensive and consistent answers to the deep questions I wanted to understand. Only during the latest years of my classical studies in High School I begun to deal with Physics and became aware of the great potential of this discipline. This is why†I chose Particle Physics for my academic studies. Eventually, this choice appears to feed both my passionate side and the rational one. Often, these two sides are not in agreement†in human beings but, again, what I\u2019ve understood is that you can control everything with your brain and let prevail your favorite side yourself! But don\u2019t wander off, Cecilia! Ok, let me focus on the main subject.†The most interesting part of my academic career is actually quite recent and related to my master degree. In early 2015 I was selected for an internship program to work on a research project with the CDF experiment. I spent eight months at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratories (FNAL or Fermilab), located near Chicago (USA), working on a refined measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel. Since the top quark mass is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, in fact, the CDF Collaboration has decided to make a major effort in order to produce its most precise measurement as a \u201clegacy\u201d of the experiment. Since the top quark discovery in 1995, different approaches have been followed by the Tevatron experiments to determine the top quark mass. In our measurement we exploited the Matrix Element (ME) method, a very powerful technique which determines the likelihood of observing an event under both ttbar and background hypotheses. The hypotheses are determined from the entire kinematic information associated to every single event by integrating the matrix element of the process over the multidimensional phase space describing the final state. For a given sample of selected events, the parameters to be measured are then determined as those values that maximize the overall likelihood. The superior statistical sensitivity of this method, with respect to other methods based on distribution-fitting, is due to the completeness of the information exploited in each event. Schematic representation of the calculation of the likelihood to obtain a given observed lepton+jets event at a proton-antiproton collider. From http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1316v2.pdf Our analysis uses the ME method to calculate a ttbar likelihood as a bi-dimensional function of the assumed top mass mt and \u0394JES, where†\u0394JES parametrizes the uncertainty in our knowledge of the jet energy scale. It is a shift applied to all jet energies in units of the jet-dependent systematic error. By introducing this parameter into the likelihood, we can use as a constraint the known W mass to determine the optimal \u0394JES and thereby reduce the final systematic error on the measured top quark mass. For the first time in CDF analyses, we included the background ME modeling in the likelihood integration, with an expected significant reduction of the systematic error of the final result. The massive calculations required by the ME method imposed to develop an unconventional and less time-consuming integration method over the phase space of the events\u2019 kinematics. In order to evaluate the multidimensional integrals, we employed a \u201cQuasi-Monte Carlo\u201d technique, based on deterministic sequences generated by choosing points approximately equally spaced in the integration space, such that equal phase space volumes contain an approximately equal number of points. The work is reported in my master thesis which represents the unique official document on the analysis. Unfortunately, 8 months were not enough to complete the entire analysis and the measurement is currently in progress. The visit at Fermilab has been a very rewarding experience for me. I had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with leading scientists of the CDF experiment, and to work with a group of top physics experts which supported me in my growth as a physicist. Wilson Hall, the iconic high-rise building at the heart of the Fermilab grounds.† Beyond the professional perspective, living at Fermilab has been a really amazing experience. The site is indeed located in a natural area where the ecosystems are rich in biodiversity, and which represents the sanctuary of the local wildlife populations, like the famous herd of American bisons. In my free time I used to take care of a little vegetable garden and, as a member of the horse club, sometimes I went riding. I came back to Italy at the end of 2015 with a great deal of love for the Nature, in all of its aspects. Two examples of Fermilab\u2019s bisons. The bison herd was established by the laboratory\u2019s first director, Robert Wilson, in 1969.† Myself working on my vegetable garden at Fermilab.† When I was about to finish my experience at Fermilab, I saw the announcement of the PhD position in Oxford related to†the AMVA4NewPhysics network and I thought that it would have been the perfect continuation of my career, given my academic path and the most recent experience on data analysis and matrix element method. It seems that I had a good intuition, and after the final sprint in Pisa, devoted to the completion of my master studies and the writing of my thesis, here I am! I moved to Oxford a couple of days ago, after a visit to CERN and a summer school in Lund (Sweden) on Machine Learning in High Energy Physics. The latter has been very interesting and, even if not really a basic level course, it has given me many starting points to understand and appreciate the subject. During my movements I also managed to meet some other ESRs of the project. But I think I need other posts to tell you about all of this stuff! I am very enthusiastic to begin this new adventure, I love traveling and meeting people from all over the world and I\u2019m sure that there will be plenty of opportunities to satisfy my ambitions. Well, that\u2019s it, for now! I\u2019ll keep you up to date! Here we are, another week has gone in Oxford. As well as in the rest of the world, you would say, but this has a particular meaning here in Oxford, and in general in the UK. Indeed the academic year, running from October to June, is organized in¬†Terms¬†which in turn are divided into 8¬†Weeks¬†each. The modern academic calendar used in the UK mainly descends¬†from the English law court system, which divided the year in four terms (Hilary, Easter, Trinity and Michaelmas), partly to create a predictable work schedule, but also to facilitate the English law students when they had to travel to London for training or legal advice. The oldest universities changed a bit the terminology over time and in Oxford we ended up with three terms, dropping the Easter Term. So currently, just to orient yourself, we are at the beginning of Week 4 of the Michaelmas term. You certainly remember that during my amazing summer¬†I already had the chance to spend some time in Oxford, but now everything is different, the academic life is intense and dynamic, I have to attend several lectures and seminars, carry out assignments on a daily basis, go regularly to meetings, and present achievements. I arrived in Oxford just in time for the Freshers‚Äô week, which takes place in Week 0 (the week before term begins) and represents the opportunity for the new students to settle into University life, make new friends, discover courses and get involved in clubs and societies. The Fresher‚Äôs week includes registration, social events and orientation activities, like the annual Fresher‚Äôs Fair,¬† a big event where you can find out more about courses, sports and recreational activities that Oxford has to offer. Some of these events are also organized by your own college. Indeed, the University of Oxford has a collegiate system, consisting of 38 self-governing colleges, related to the central University by a federal system. Each student, after having been¬†admitted to¬†the University, is selected and becomes member of one college, which will provide accommodation, meals, common rooms, libraries, sports, and social facilities for its¬†students during the years of study. The collegiate system gives the students the benefits of belonging both to a large, internationally renowned institution and to a small, interdisciplinary academic community. But that‚Äôs not all! If you are a new student in Oxford you should be matriculated. Matriculation is one of the most famous Oxford traditions and consists in the ceremony that marks the formal admission to the University. It takes place at the beginning of Michaelmas term in the Sheldonian Theatre, the official¬†ceremonial hall¬†of the University of Oxford, where the Vice-Chancellor welcomes the new students and reads out the following traditional Latin speech: ‚ÄúScitote vos in Matriculam Universitatis hodie relatos esse, et ad observandum omnia Statuta istius Universitatis, quantum ad vos spectent, teneri‚Äù (‚ÄúKnow that you are today added to the Roll of the University and bound to obey all the statutes of this University so far as they apply to you‚Äù).  Matriculants are required to wear the academic dress with sub-fusc during the ceremony. The academic dress includes a gown and a cap (a mortarboard). Sub-fusc (from the Latin for ‚Äòbeneath dark coloured‚Äô) is the formal outfit worn with the academic dress. It comprises a dark suit, black shoes, a¬†white¬†shirt, a black tie or a white bow tie. The result was a very suggestive scenario, at least for the astonished tourists: the streets in Oxford were filled with students in formal dress, bunches of aspiring Harry Potters (really, some of them are only missing the magic wand!) marching toward their (hopefully) brilliant future! Me on Matriculation day. Beyond the peculiar traditions, being a graduate student in Oxford has many advantages. Many resources are provided, like a wide range of library services. Also several courses are available to increase knowledge inside and outside your own research field, both in class and online. Many seminars are organized by the Department, where special guests are invited to talk about the most recent scientific achievement. One specific example: a few days ago Professor Gabriela Gonzales, the spokesperson of the LIGO experiment, came to the Physics Department to talk about the recent direct observation of gravitational waves. In that circumstance, some of us also had the opportunity to have lunch with her and ask questions before the talk.¬†It¬†was really exiting and unique! Professor Gabriela Gonzales, spokesperson of LIGO, presenting the results on the first direct observation of gravitational waves.¬† This is just a taste of what happens in Oxford,¬†if I made you want to be part of this reality, I suggest you take a look at this link and maybe you will decide to apply to the University of Oxford. Go now, you could be the next Harry Potter! \u0111üòâ One of the many things that physicists have to deal with on a daily basis is present their results. However, this also applies for many other professional figures, which are required to make presentations as a part of their job. Presentations always start with a subject which can be more or less interesting for the audience, but the key tool is a set of great slides. Whatever is the knowledge to be imparted or idea to be spread or result to be shared, your skills on presenting can make the difference. Certainly, the style of a presentation will change according to the topic and the modality. A physicist, for example, almost always works with people which are not actually in the same place, so in order to keep up to date on the progress of the work we usually make videoconference meetings from our own desktop. But in general there are some basic rules for achieving a balanced, professional, attractive and compelling presentation. It\u2019s worth taking a look! Prime components Data and story. It\u2019s important to present your data in the context of a storyline. Data is not what matters, it\u2019s the meaning of the data that matters. Different stories involve different approaches and style. Rule #0 Don\u2019t decorate your presentation like it\u2019s a Christmas tree. Design is about communication, about choosing the right tools to communicate your message. Your tools are type, color, image and layout. So get rid of all the impersonal Power Point templates and design your story (whatever, your analysis, your product, your project..) with flair. Clarity Present one point at a time. Don\u2019t pile stuff on to your slides. A good presentation eliminates everything except the one essential thing that you are conveying at a given moment. In general charts and graphs, bullet points and subheads are to avoid. For a physics presentation it is required to give more details and plots but even in this particular case don\u2019t miss the essential point you are communicating. Simplicity Slides consist of three simple element: background, words, image. Keep them simple. Use a plane background and a high contrast. The highest contrast is black against white, or white against black. When it\u2019s possible choose your background for the room you will be in: light for a light room, dark for a dark room. Type on a colored field can be very attractive but will generally be harder to read. Also, many slides with a colored background can get tiring fast, because color communicates at an emotional level and this is very demanding. So use colors sparingly, neutral colors like black, white and grey are preferable. Use one clear typeface of medium weight. There are thousands and thousands of fonts to choose from but it\u2019s not worth spend too much time picking the best one. You can easily find suggestions on the web from expert designer. Serif fonts are those fonts that have little hooks (or \u2018Serifs\u2019) on the end of letters. For presentations a sans-serif style (without serif) is recommended because it is easier to look and more readable, especially from a distance. Just to make some example: Helvetica, Arial, Avenir, Myriad are common choices for sans-serif face. However, for some topics you\u2019ll want serif fonts like Baskerville, Century, Garamond. Generally speaking, serif styles feel warmer and richer than sans serif styles. Avoid mixing different styles. Image is any graphical element: plots, graphs, diagrams, photographs. Just a couple of points: plots has to be clear and axis title readable; if you use a photo as clip art or metaphor, take care it doesn\u2019t look cheesy. Color A little bit of color looks much different from a lot of color. A spot of red, for example, is a great way to highlight something, it\u2019s a focal point. A full screen of red, however, is too much and does not catch your eyes on the essential point. Also, use de-saturated colors, they are less demanding and easy to work with. Finally, a good rule of thumb is to use three colors or less. Once you have defined your own template which includes a set of parameters like the page margin, the typeface, a small color palette, use it consistently from the beginning to the end of the presentation. Consider that every difference in style, size, color, and position conveys a difference in meaning. Bold says something different from light. Big says something different from small. The position of an object in the slide has a specific meaning. If you make differences, be sure they\u2019re design decisions and not accidental. So far I have just covered the main arguments but there is more, presentation is a wide art. Wherever there\u2019s knowledge to be imparted or ideas to be spread, your skills at presenting can make all the difference. If you want to improve your skills I suggest to start with this course† on lynda.com. All the best for your next presentation! A few days ago I left Padua, where I spent one intensive month, working with other network members and ESR fellows (Giles, Greg and Pablo) at the Statistical Department. A first observation When people from different disciplines work together, like in the case of physicists and statisticians, the first stumbling block is the communication. This is mostly because we are used to thinking in different ways to solve problems of different nature. But even when we deal with the same context, we often use different specific words to describe the same thing. For example, a signal search is called anomaly detection in statistical language. Our kinematic variables are called features by†statisticians. Also, sometimes we use the same word or acronym to designate different concepts (pdf, model etc.). But, after an initial period of training, everyone can learn a lot in interdisciplinary collaborations such as our network. Indeed, despite the initial difficulty, we managed to understand each other and proceed with the work. Status of the work You certainly remember that in July, Alessia and Giles joined me in Oxford to work on the Monte Carlo (MC) generation of the samples needed for our studies on the pair production of Higgs bosons in the bbbb and bb\u03c4\u03c4 final states. On that occasion, we produced the samples for the signal and background processes, summarized in the following table. The samples had been generated at the parton level by using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, a framework that provides the elements necessary for Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomenology, such as the computation of cross sections and the generation of hard events from the simulated collisions between elementary particles. Then, the MadGraph output files had been showered and hadronised by Pythia8, another C++ based high energy physics event generator. We eventually passed the output through Delphes, which performs a fast and realistic simulation of a general purpose collider detector, like ATLAS and CMS. Now, what we did†in Padua was a first study for the classification of these signal and background processes. Our studies in the network, indeed, include the development and refinement of tools suitable for the discrimination between signal and background. But, be careful, this is not the final goal! Once we have optimized the higher performance tool, the plan is to use that tool to make a statistical inference, which means drawing conclusions based on data (special thanks to Pablo for shedding light on this sensitive issue and a lot more!). How and what conclusions we will draw have yet to be determined. Starting from a baseline, provided by Giles, which makes use of some libraries implemented in Python, in particular, we trained a deep neural network (DNN). We then compared the DNN result with a XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) classifier. The month spent in Padua has shown to be really useful to get myself started on Machine Learning (ML). I†got†the possibility to discuss the main ideas with the other ESRs and I received many suggestions in order to improve my knowledge in this discipline. I also started†attending†an online course on ML, which seems to be very promising and possibly I will tell you about†it†when I finish it. Enjoying Padua Besides the great work with the†other†network participants, during this month I had the opportunity to visit a wonderful city I had never visited before and to savour my last few moments in Italy, before moving to the UK. Now, instead of bothering you with the tales of Cecilia\u2019s Travels, I will leave you with a photo gallery of the beauties and goodness I found in Padua! This slideshow requires JavaScript. Have you ever wondered how Facebook suggests the tags for the picture you post on your wall, or how the photo library on your computer manages to automatically create albums containing pictures of particular people? Well, they use facial recognition software based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN is the most popular and effective method for object recognition, and it is a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a known grid-like topology. The network employs a mathematical operation called convolution which allows it to extract a set of features from the input image. The main architecture is the same as a \u201cregular\u201d neural network, consisting of multiple stacked layers of inter-connected neurons (for a very nice review on the topic see the \u201cUnderstanding Neural Network\u201d series by Giles Strong). The main difference here is that the inputs are images characterized by a three-dimensional structure: height, width and pixel intensity. The first layers in the structure learn to recognize simple patterns such as lines, edges or corners in the input image; intermediate layers might recognize more complex patterns, like an eye or a nose; eventually, later layers happen to locate and recognize major objects in the image, like a human face or a dog. There are a lot of examples of recent and really exciting applications of CNNs. If you have been recently feeling like an artist by transforming your banal selfie into a piece of art, you probably have used Prisma, a photo-editing mobile app (https://www.facebook.com/getprisma/) which utilizes a CNN to transform the pictures into an artistic effect. Or maybe you\u2019ve heard about automatic lip reading sentences (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05358.pdf) or instant visual translation (https://research.googleblog.com/2015/07/how-google-translate-squeezes-deep.html). I could go on and on, but I have something else to tell you today. Just keep in mind that we are talking about a very powerful and widely applicable tool. Given that, and remembering that we are physicists mainly interested in physics searches, we are wondering if there is any chance to use these promising methods for physics analyses. Obviously the answer is yes! And this is what I\u2019d like to focus on today. It turns out that CNNs are well suited to measurements that exploit a particular class of detectors, such as sampling calorimeters that use scintillators, liquid argon time projection chambers and water Cherenkov detectors. These kinds of detectors, widely used in high energy neutrino physics, allows to record the amount of energy deposited in small regions throughout the volume of the detector. The result is a collection of images of the physics interactions that can be treated with CNNs. A very interesting recent application of CNNs for neutrino event classification has been performed by the NOvA collaboration and reported in this article. NOvA is a long baseline neutrino experiment. The Near Detector is located at Fermilab, where the neutrino beam (almost pure in \u03bd\u03bc) is produced, and the Far Detector is about 800 km away near Ash River, Minnesota. The main goal of NOvA is to make precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters by looking at the disappearance of \u03bd\u03bc and the consequent appearance of \u03bde .† The oscillation phenomenon originates from the fact that we can describe neutrinos on two different bases, one described by mass eigenstates and the other by flavor eigenstates. What we conventionally call a neutrino is a state that is produced in a weak interaction, with a well defined flavor (e, \u03bc, \u03c4).† We can switch from one description to the other via a mixing matrix, meaning that the flavor state is composed of a superposition of mass eigenstates that are allowed to evolve in time (following the Schroedinger equation). This means that as neutrinos propagate through space, their content changes as a function of the distance and we can observe a different composition in the neutrino beam reaching the Far Detector. Precision measurements of oscillation require an optimal reconstruction of neutrino energy and flavor state. The flavor can be determined in charged-current (CC) interactions (with the detector material), which produce a charged lepton in the final state that has the same flavor as the interacting neutrino, in addition to an hadronic component. Every kind of interaction will produce a peculiar signature. The muon produced in a \u03bd\u03bc† interaction, for instance, leaves a long track, due to the low dE/dx typical of a minimal ionizing particle. The evidence of the electron coming from a \u03bde† interaction is instead characterized by a wide shower, rather than a track. Furthermore, neutrinos can interact via neutral-current (NC) interactions. In this case the final state lepton is a neutrino, which will travel onwards undetected, without displaying information about the flavor state. Here the hadronic component can mimic the electron activity and then the entire process can be mistaken for a CC interaction. NC interactions in this case are treated as background for CC analyses. So, let\u2019s cut to the chase. The NOvA collaboration literally uses the images of the detector interactions interpreted as pixel maps to feed a state-of-the-art CNN to classify the candidate neutrino events into one of the interaction types. The CNN is implemented using Caffe, an open source framework for deep learning applications and trained over millions of Far Detector events for several categories (depending on further classification of the interaction). The output of the CNN, shown in figure, can be interpreted as the probability of the input event falling in one of the main categories, surviving \u03bd\u03bc CC or appearing \u03bde CC type. In both cases an excellent separation is obtained with the CNN. A natural way to evaluate the performance of the CNN is the comparison with the results obtained with sophisticated identification algorithms commonly in use by the collaboration. In the surviving \u03bd\u03bc channel the CNN obtains a separation of the signal versus background with an efficiency of 58%, representing a modest improvement with respect to previous results. The significant gain is observed in the \u03bde appearance where a classification efficiency of 49% considerably outperforms the 35% of common algorithms. Since the separation of \u03bde† CC signal from the background is particularly hard and is statistically limited, this improvement is very significant. The amazing work of the NOvA collaboration shows that CNNs represent a powerful approach to event classification and work well also with non-natural images like the readout of sampling calorimeters. The same approach could be exploited in future by a wider range of detector technologies and analyses. Let me just say that I have noticed that the physics community has some reservations about the reliability of these methods when applied to physics analyses. In particular, it seems quite hard to obtain reliable results in collider physics, but on the other hand it\u2019s true that there is a lot of excitement around the topic, so I think it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out!
