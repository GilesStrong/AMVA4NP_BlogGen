V Hi there! So, in a recent blog post IÂ told a bit about me. However, this morning I was lazily re-reading it, when I suddenly remembered that a text is nothing more than a collection of elements, linked one to each other by some rules (grammar) and some standard associations: by standard associations, I mean that the topic you are writing about dictates the words that you are most likely to use. For example, if you are writing about baking a cake, you are more likely to use terms as oven, wheat, eggs, than if you are writing about a guidance system for missiles. Hopefully \u0111Ÿ˜€ This lead me to remember two concepts: frequency tablesÂ and Markov Chains. Frequency tables are very simple: you take an input text, you pick each word, and you count how many times it is followed by another word. For example, you take hot, and you might discover that 60% of the times it is followed by cake, andÂ 40% of the times by topic. You do that for each word of the text. Source: Wikipedia.org And now we come to the awesome part, that is the Markov chain stuff: a Markov chain is, as Wikipedia puts it, Â a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. In layman\u2019s terms, this means a process in which the evolution of the systemÂ depen ds only on the current state of the system, and not on its past history. This means that you only need an initial state and a decision rule for any given state in order to perform a full evolution of the system, but that the future evolution will not depend on that initial state: it will depend only on the state immediately preceding any further state. Let\u2019s apply it to our text, to make it clear. Let\u2019s say that from our input text we select as initial state the word hot. If we take our frequency table to be our decision rule, we see that we can generate the next word of our new text by picking up either cake with 60% probability or topic with 40% probability. Let\u2019s say we picked cake. Now, to generate the next word, we look at the frequency table for the word cake, whichÂ might be constituted by made 90% of the times and from 10% of the times. We would obtain then either hot cake made or hot cake from. As you can see, the probability of picking up made or fromÂ depends only on the frequency table (our decision rule) and not on the past state of the system: it is not a function of the frequency table for the word hot.Â If we modified the frequency table for hot, when eventually arrivingÂ at the word cakeÂ we would still have an evolution dictated by a 90% probability of finding made and 10% of finding from. Good, we have all the ingredients for a little game, but we need one thing: some software to do that for us. Since it is Sunday and I have stuff to do (involving cleaning the house and having a nice walk), I did not write myself the code for such a method (I might do it in the next days, though). I just foundÂ some code from Andrew Plotkin, which is very nice, also because it enables to group words together. Since the language rules are quite strict (both in terms of grammar and in terms of associations), instead of building a frequency table for single words we can build a frequency table for pairs of words. This will enable us to find groups of words that will be more likely to be following our usual grammar rules, resulting in a text that will somehow make more sense. Another very nice feature of Andrew\u2019s code is that it includes punctuation and paragraph division in the count, thus making the output text much more realistic. OK, what else do we need? Well, an input text, of course! Let\u2019s take myÂ presentation postÂ and say that we want to generate 1000 words using frequency tables built by pairs of words. Here is the result, that I will comment below: Hi! Very shamefully, this is my first year, I looked at the University of Oviedo, in Spain. Here, my analysis work will be oriented to searches of new physics, mostly in the stat stuff\u201d for the first pages, it already promises to be built in a future multivariate study. During my Ph.D. in Lisbon, I started to read a Spanish series of books called \u201cLas aventuras de capit\u0102\u0104n Alatriste\u201d (The Adventures of Captain Alatriste) that reportedly is the Spanish region Oviedo is the heavier brother of the Tevatron accelerator, near Chicago), so there I started working at simple tasks as learning how to plot variables. An additional internship experience, the following year, finally convinced me that the challenge of their energy. The results were somehow inconclusive, though, leaving just the hope of being able to exploit one particular variable in a future multivariate study. During my summer student I had the patience of arriving here) and encourage you to drop by in the CMS detector. I moved then to the Higgs decay topology. Actually, digging up old emails: by removing QCD events via the Neural Network, the resolution on the value of some ongoing war, had been performed by Ohio University on improving the di-jet mass got down from 18.0% to 10.7%, according to some criteria, and finally you redo the whole process a few non-work-related bits about me! I always loved reading (thanks to my notes!!! For the master thesis, I switched to the measurement of the work is to distinguish jets from hadronically decaying taus. I exploited this final state also in the stat stuff\u201d for the jets coming from quarks of type \u201cb\u201d have some peculiar characteristics, that can be exploited to classify events into \u201csignal-like\u201d events and \u201cbackground-like\u201d events. For this classification problem, I used a machine learning technique called Boosted Decision Trees, which is somehow an extension of the BDT permitted to enhance significantly (in some cases even by 50%) the ability of choosing, in the CMS detector. I moved then to the CMS experiment at the University of Oviedo group that is joining the network: more on the society. I went on to humanities high school and beyond. Nowadays, I would have chosen on the basis of the most recent years I started to play live roleplaying games: the difference is that you are not seated around a table describing what your characters do; you are roaming around a table describing what your characters do; you are roaming around a room, or a garden, or a town, effectively acting as if you were your character. This implies that you can forget stuff typical of a heavy charged Higgs decays mostly into a top quark mass as a function of the blog (Sabine, the Press Office of the network!), so I will summarize the rest quite briefly: also, I must only say that it is expected to find two jets is not known (there are neutrinos, and when we collide two proton beams we don\u2019t know exactly the longitudinal momentum of the muon, and its signature characteristic is that it simply reflects my prior ranking of all the possible discriminant variables: this way, I would then skip mentioning the fact that this practice helped me with my general dialectic skills. If you drop by in the CMS experiment at Tevatron, where I am reading none of them: I just began my postdoc at the Conservatory. I was preparing for a direct search of a solid scientific result. It is actually a pity that a non-negligible part of what an experimental physicist should know is not really \u201cwork\u201d. During my Ph.D. last July, and am currently in the comments for any question. For now, talk to you in the event, the correct pair of jets for the production of a heavy charged Higgs boson is lower than 173 GeV), the charged Higgs boson decaying into a tau and a bottom quark! Across the years of my Ph.D., so right now I am still working nowadays. There, I worked on something we call \u201cVBF H->ZZ->mumubb\u201d Higgs boson decaying into two muons and the other side (Then you do this many times, for many variables, according to some criteria, and finally you redo the whole process a few hundred or thousand times). So, what has the result been? Well, it turned out that the Higgs boson search: OK, what the hell does this mean? Let\u2019s start with \u201cH\u201d: that is the coolest physicist you might think about, if you were your character. This implies that you can forget stuff typical of the LHC). How on Earth did I end up doing these things? During primary school I already knew that I just began my postdoc at the LHC, where I was a typical search channel for a heavy charged Higgs boson with mass higher than the top quark pair events in the context of a solid scientific result. It is actually a pity that a non-negligible part of what an experimental physicist working in the near future. Uh, and I soon became fascinated by the idea of becoming a lawyer (not a judge. Lawyer is cooler: Perry Mason was a typical search channel for a heavy charged Higgs boson we discovered could have some delicate statistics issue: having direct access to tricky and delicate conversations on statistics boosted and is boosting my understanding and experience in this blog some posts from Giles and from my former supervisor Jo\u0102\u0141o Varela), where I have probably started to think that most likely the most amiable professor. Back at the time gathering useful documentation on the network blog: I hope to make up for this by spamming writing a reasonable amount of Well, what can we say? First of all, there are some scrambled bits that are quite funny (meaning that from a grammatical point of viewÂ they make sense, but they say unexpected things), but we can also see that there are entire phrases that appear exactly as they appeared in the original blog post! Why is that? Well, this is simple: the frequency tables are often composed by a 100% probability of going to a given additional word, and this is due to the fact that the original blog post is composed by roughly 3000 words; this is not enough to have multiple choices in most of the steps. What if we tried to use a longer input text? Well, I tried using as an input Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, for a total of 78451 words, and generated a 1000-words text out of it, using again a frequency table built for 2-words groups. Here is the output, that I will comment on below: Harry Potter and the Weasley twins insisted that nothing had been trying to getÂ past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was laden down with rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke theirÂ teeth, but Harry and felt it. It was chalk white with glaring redÂ eyes and slits for nostrils, like a toothless walnut. TheÂ low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to have forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI saw you and me, that\u2019s saying something.

Everything looked so grim and worried, orÂ why they had been given a wildÂ jerk and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing \u2014 did the stranger you were trying to reason with him. \u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood. \u201cEr \u2014 okay,\u201d said Harry. \u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one second!\u201d He walked forward and pointed at the lights of passing cars andÂ wondering\u2026. They didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they spotted aÂ notice pinned up in the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway. Harry was glad school was over, Hagrid himself was in the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty becauseÂ George Weasley really did fall off his thick black coat and threw them into a nightmare \u2014 this year, the third-floor corridor \u2014 and the round-facedÂ boy Harry had to be working with Hagrid itÂ wouldn\u2019t budge, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,Â swapping rumors.\u201d She threw a dirty look at him and he got hisÂ revenge, without even realizing he was a plump woman who was quite bald and looked up at Harry, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked like aÂ cork shot out of aÂ centaur. Ruddy stargazers.

There we are. Behold the power of Markov Chains! Grammatically, most of the text is OK, and the sentences kind of make sense, although in a bizarre way (well, the bizarre part was our purpose fromÂ the beginning, uh? \u0111Ÿ˜‰ ). The most astounding characteristic, though, is that the output text is by construction statistically equivalent to the input one (at least, if we take the set of frequencies as an estimator of statistical equivalence)! Markov chains can actually be used to analyze texts in order to decide if they are similar, which could enable to make some inference about authorship. For example,Â if we findÂ a new Shakespeare theater piece, we can compare it statistically with the full Shakespeare corpus and determine if it is compatible or not! Of course this is not a 100% secure method (authors change style, for example, or write in a different way for different purposes), but still it is something I find quite impressive! If you want to explore the world of computer-generated text, though, you could go on and check stuff based onÂ context-free grammar, which is basically a set of rules that, given a formal grammar, can generate any possible string regardless of the context. It might seem silly, but computer-generated texts have gone way beyond simple examples like the ones I gave you. A software called Mathgen had a computer-generated gibberish textÂ accepted for publicationÂ in an advanced mathematics journal! Similarly, the authors of SCIgen managed to get invited to a conference by sending a computer-generated paper, asÂ they describe in a Reddit AMA. In one of the answers, by the way, they discuss also Markov chain generators: we explicitly avoided Markov chains or anything else that was technically challenging, in the service of trying to make the papers as funny as possible. With Markov chains, you might get something syntactically correct, but it is likely to be boring. Well, it is time for me to start cooking: I hope you found Markov chains as awesome as I do think they are! If you want to play with them, you can download and compile Andrew\u2019s code (just add a #include<string> on top, and compile with cc or gcc), or find some more generators online! By the way, if you like Harry Potter, you might find some amusement in readingÂ Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is a fan-fiction revisitingÂ the original books by applying the scientific method to Harry\u2019s world! Have a nice Sunday (or whichever day this will be published \u0111Ÿ˜› )! P.S. No Muggle has been hurt during the preparation of this post. Hi! Very shamefully, this is my first post on the network blog: I hope to make up for this by spamming writing a reasonable amount of posts in the near future. For now, a brief presentation of myself \u0111Ÿ™‚ My name is Pietro Vischia. I come from Padova, in Italy, where I was born and where I got my bachelor and master degree in Physics. I then moved to Lisbon (you might have read in this blog some posts from Giles and from my former supervisor Jo\u0102\u0141o Varela), where I got my Ph.D. last July, and now I am in Oviedo in Spain, for my postdoc. Me \u2013 Photo by Marta Teixeira   I am an experimental physicist working in the CMS experiment at the LHC, but I originally come from the CDF experiment at Tevatron, where I didÂ my bachelor degree and spent an awesome time as a summer student at FermiLab (the mega laboratory near Chicago which hosts Tevatron, which is to many respects the predecessor of the LHC). How on Earth did I end up doing these things? During primary school I already knew that I wanted to become a cop: something must have gone wrong! Well, as far as I can remember, the idea of becoming a cop already changed, right before high school, into the idea of becoming a lawyer (not a judge. Lawyer is cooler: Perry Mason was a lawyer, not a judge): after all, they earnÂ more money and they can have a larger impact on the society. I went on to humanities high school (in Italian it is called Liceo Classico), where the study of Greek and Latin and their ancient language and culture, as well as philosophy, made me think I actually wanted to become a philosopher, heavily biased towards symbolic logic and such. In parallel,Â I was preparing for a backup career as a composer and orchestra director, by studying and passing exams at the Conservatory. I was quite prolific as a classical music composer, by the way (and my Maestro said I was writing reasonably good stuff!). However, the curriculum of the Liceo included also some math (starting from the first year) and science (starting from the third year with chemistry), and I soon became fascinated by the idea of studying how nature actually works instead of just memorizing the rules of men or elaborating mind constructions without confronting them with reality. However, chemistry, the way it was taught, seemed not rigorous and \u201clogic\u201d enough for me (\u201cif it\u2019s not logic, it is bullshit\u201d). This opened up the way for falling in love with physics during my fourth year of high school (in Italy, high school lasts five years): things seemed to be built in a more logic way. In retrospective, I guess I could have arbitrarily settledÂ at any of these steps, depending on theÂ events of life, so somehow I guess I am a physicist by luck: I got fascinated by stuff in the right order at the right time. Of course, what is the coolest physicist you might think about, if you haven\u2019t really been exposed to science and hence to the different possible flavours of physicists? The nuclear physicist! Soon after the beginning of the university courses, I started to think that most likely the most interesting (hence cooler) field was astrophysics. However, an awesome thing happened: the physics departmentÂ used to give the opportunity to students to work with various physicists on different topics, for two or three weeks during each summer (some sort of summer internship program). Right after my first year, I looked at the list of available internships and decided that since I did not have a real preference I would have chosen on the basis of the most amiable professor. Back at the time, I though it was vaguely ridiculous. Nowadays, I would just say that it is an estimator as any other and that it simply reflects my prior ranking of all the possible discriminant variables: this way, I would then skip mentioning the fact that this does not make it in any way less or more ridiculous. In any case, I chose the internship led by Giovanni Busetto, who is very-very-awesome and hadÂ taught me a lab course (measuring stuff in electric circuits, Â measuring stuff in optics \u2013 thingsÂ like that). He happened to be working within the CDF experiment (CDF is a detector that was located in one of the interaction points of the Tevatron accelerator, near Chicago) together with some bloke named Tommaso Dorigo: I am sure you have heard about him, here\u2026 Anyways, as a newcomer, I started working at simple tasks like learning how to plot variables. An additional internship experience with him, the following year, finally convinced meÂ that the funniest and coolest thing is particle physics, so here I am \u0111Ÿ˜€ Now that I established that I am a particle physicists just by sheer luck, let\u2019s venture into a longish description of my working career. My bachelor degree aimed at improvingÂ the accuracy with which CDF measured the energy of jets of particles coming from the hadronization of b quarks. To put it briefly,Â quarks are usually detected in the form of \u201cjets\u201d of particles (pictorially like a swarm of bullets from a shotgun): jets coming from quarks of type \u201cb\u201d have some peculiar characteristics that can be used to identify them and to improve the measurement of their energy. The results were somehow inconclusive, though, leaving just the hope of being able to exploit one particular variable in a future multivariate study. During my time in the Fermilab Summer Student program, I had my first real encounter with multivariate analysis methods, in particular machine learning: in university courses, at least in physics, this stuff was not covered at all. Right now the situation seems to be slowly improving, but it still depends on the effort of individual dedicated people that push for creating optional classes or mini-workshops. My task was to replicate some preliminary studies that had been performed by Ohio University on improving the di-jet mass resolution and the discrimination between events featuring a Z boson decaying into two b quarks from events of pure QCD (basically, events with many jets). Di-jet mass means \u201ctake two jets and consider them a single object: which is its mass?\u201d, whereas resolution is a quantity that tells us how well we measure that quantity: higher values are bad, low values are good! At that time,Â the software used for the analysis of events, ROOT, had some basic experimental support for Neural Networks, which was however mostly undocumented. Actually, I spent most of the time gathering useful documentation on the basics of Neural Networks! The study yielded some encouraging results, as far as I could judge by digging up old emails: by removing QCD events via the Neural Network the resolution on theÂ di-jet mass wentÂ down fromÂ 18.0% to 10.7%, according to my notes!!! For the master thesis, I switched to the CMS experiment at the LHC, where I am still working nowadays. There, I worked on something we call \u201cVBF Hâ†’ZZâ†’Î\u017aÎ\u017abb\u201d Higgs boson search: OK, what the hell does this mean? Let\u2019s start with \u201cH\u201d: that is the Higgs boson, that at the time had not been discovered yet. Hâ†’ZZ means that the Higgs boson decays into two Z bosons, ZZâ†’Î\u017aÎ\u017abb means that one of the Z bosons decays into two muons and the other into two b quarks. That was a typical search channel for a Higgs boson, but it is affected by large backgrounds. AÂ background, in general, is some other process that produces the same type of particles after the collision. In this case, something that produces two muons and two b quarks. A typical example is the top quark pair production. In order to improve the situation, one can limit the search by imposing constraints on the way the Higgs boson is produced: \u201cVBF\u201d, standing for \u201cvector boson fusion\u201d, is a particular production mechanism whose peculiarity is that in the final state you expectÂ to find two jets with extremely large momentum. The presence of these two jets is not typical forÂ the backgrounds to the Higgs boson production and decay, hence their characteristics can be exploited to classify events into \u201csignal-like\u201d events and \u201cbackground-like\u201d events. For this classification problem, I used a machine learning technique called Boosted Decision Trees, which is somehow an extension of the concept of performing cuts on the value of some variable aiming at increasingÂ the fraction of signal-like events on one side of the cut and of background-like events on the other side. (Then you do this many times, for many variables, according to some criteria, and finally you redo the whole process a few hundred or thousand times). So, what wasÂ the result? Well, it turned out that the separation between signal and background did not increase significantly if compared to single-variable cuts. However, using the output of the BDT permitted to enhance significantly (in some cases even by 50%) the ability of choosing the correct pair of jets for the jets coming from the vector boson fusion. This, in turn,Â allowsÂ to assign more often the correct pair of jets toÂ the jets coming from the decay Zâ†’bb, which enhances the capacity of reconstructing correctly the event and thus opens the way to a more detailed study of the Higgs decay topology. Actually, digging up the past presentations and theses in order to make sure I report things correctly has been a very interesting exercise: I had indeed forgotten many details of these works of mine! Well, I have probably started to bore you, so I will summarize the rest quite briefly: also, I must say that I have just written an entire thesis about my Ph.D., so right now to describe it again is kind of boooooooooring for me. Programmatically, I try to mostly do fun stuff, because if it is fun it can still be tiring but it is not really \u201cwork\u201d. During my Ph.D. in Lisbon, I started by joining a measurement of the top quark mass in top quark pair events in the dilepton final state. The mass measurement method used was calledÂ kinematic methodÂ andÂ had been originally developed within the CDF experiment. It consists in computing the top quark mass as a function of the full kinematic quantities of the event. Since the full kinematics of the event is not known (there are neutrinos that we don\u2019t detect and when we collide two proton beams we don\u2019t know exactly the longitudinal momentum of the individual protons that collided), it is necessary for each event to solve 50000 times the system of equations that determines the event. As a progress with respect to the original CDF method, we exploited the information on the identification of jets coming from b quarks, whichÂ has a much better performance for the CMS detector. I then moved to the measurement of the cross section of top quark pairs in final states containing \u010e„ leptons. The \u010e„ lepton is the heavier brother of the electron and of the muon and its signature characteristic is that it decays most of the times into a cluster of particles (it decays hadronically), mimicking the hadronization of a quark: this means that the challenge of the work is to distinguish jets from hadronically decaying taus. I exploited this final state also in the search for something called charged Higgs boson: the idea is that, in case new physics exists, the Higgs boson we discovered could have some heavier brothers, sometimes with an electric charge (hence labeled charged Higgs boson). When the mass of such a boson is lower than the top quark mass (i.e. lower than 173 GeV), the charged Higgs boson decays mostly into a \u010e„ and a neutrino: that\u2019s Â why we chose to investigate a final state with tausÂ despite the challenge of their identification. The really cool part, though, was when I passed to the search for a heavy charged Higgs boson (i.e. a charged Higgs boson with mass higher than the aforementioned 173 GeV): in that situation, the charged Higgs decays mostly into a top quark and a bottom quark (modulo the electrical charges of the stuff, so either top and anti-bottom or anti-top and bottom). The result I obtained is the first result for a direct search of a heavy charged Higgs boson decaying into a top and a bottom quark! Across the years of my Ph.D., I realized more and more that statistics is very important for the production of a solid scientific result. It is actually a pity that a non-negligible part of what an experimental physicist should know is not taught in standard university courses. At some point, I had the opportunity of entering the CMS Statistics Committee, a group of people in the CMS experiment that are tasked with \u201cchecking the stat stuff\u201d for the experiment, formulating and giving suggestions when possible to colleagues that might have some delicate statistics issue: having direct access to Â tricky and delicate conversations on statistics boosted and is boosting my understanding and experience in this topic! To finish this work related jibber-jabber, I must only say that I have just begun my postdoc at the University of Oviedo, in Spain. Here, my analysis work will be oriented to searches of new physics, mostly in the context of a theory called Super Symmetry: SUSY, for friends, while keeping my commitment in the stat stuff for my experiment and expanding it with some personal project. I joined the AMVA4NewPhysics network during my Ph.D. in the context ofÂ my Portuguese institution: so far, I mostly developed together with Tommaso a nice new multivariate algorithm, called inverse bagging, that I presented recently at a conference and that willÂ be the object of a blog post in the near future. Uh, and I am currently the Outreach Officer of the network, which kind of adds shame to this being my first blog post. Ehem. I am keeping my involvement in AMVA4NP, and am the project PI of the University of Oviedo group that is joining the network: more on the group in another post \u0111Ÿ˜‰ As finishing remarks, here are a few non-work-related bits about me! I have always loved reading (thanks to my parents for inculcating in my mind the love for reading!), and up to a couple of years into university I was also writing music and playing the piano. I should definitely re-take some music into my hands. Anyways, back to reading: I am an avid reader, ranging from narrative to essays to the shampoo composition and instructions (not kidding). In the most recent yearsÂ I have enjoyed a lot digging into crime novels, but paradoxically right now I am reading none of them. I just started readingÂ a Spanish series of books called \u201cLas aventuras de capit\u0102\u0104n Alatriste\u201d (The Adventures of Captain Alatriste) that reportedly is the Spanish equivalent of Dumas\u2019 musketeers series. From the first pages, it already promises to be AWESOME. When I was a child, I used to draw a lot (seriously, A LOT), but then I stopped, except for my awesome notes taken during courses that always featured pirate ships: I have read too many novels from Salgari about pirates and corsairs. And yes, pirates and corsairs are not the same thing! Corsairs were privateers, i.e. people that, because of some ongoing war, had been granted a commission of war: basically, legalized pirates (if you listened to the country granting the commission. They were still hanged by the enemy country)! Also, the commission was usually valid against a specific nation, so if a British corsair with a commission against Spain attacked a French ship, the British themselves would normally consider him a pirate. Complicated times. In any case, a couple of years ago I restarted drawing, encouraged by a dear friend,Â Lara (check out some of her work!!!),Â and am currently in the process of (very slowly) improving my skills with watercolour. I have been convinced/compelled/tricked into even uploading my (still bad) drawings in a blog, but I won\u2019t tell you where. Haha. I have a passion for languages. Before high school I had studied English and French, but then I perfected only English in high school and beyond. Nowadays, I practice French mainly during my trips to CERN. Thanks to having livedÂ in Portugal I learned Portuguese. The same friend that pushed me into drawing also taught me Spanish (perk: I arrived in Spain already speaking some kind of version of Spanish with many Asturian expressions \u2013 Asturias is the Spanish region Oviedo is the capital of). A couple of years ago I started studying German with an awesome teacher (Nora, that recently created a non-profit association of language teachersÂ working also via skype), but then had to stop for the finishing-the-PhD haze: I plan to restart around December! I like to play computer games: mainly RPGs-stuff like Gothic or Skyrim or Assassin\u2019s Creed and first-person-shooters-stuff like Call of Duty or Vietcong or Battlefield. I love roleplaying games (Dungeons and DragonsÂ and Vampire, mostly, plus some indie systems like Dread), and play quite often since something like 15 years ago. In the last couple of years I started to play live roleplaying games. The difference is that you are not seated around a table describing what your characters do, but you are roaming around a room, or a garden, or a town, effectively acting as if you were your character. This implies that you can forget stuff typical of a pen&paper game such as \u201cI break the wall with my fists\u201d or the most common development for the first D&D session of a campaign (\u201cWe burn the tavern to the ground\u201d), but it is more immersive and focused on interpersonal skills. Actually, I must say that this practice helped me with my general dialectic skills. If you drop by Lisbon, check out the folks fromÂ Olisippo Obscura! My next project is to create a campaign in Oviedo, by the way! Well, I think I have to end this post here, lest I incur in warnings by the awesome editor of the blog (Sabine, the Press Office Coordinator of the network), so I thank you for the attention (provided you had the patience of arriving up to here) and encourage you to drop by in the comments for any question. For now, talk to you in the next post! You can also find me on twitter, with the handle @pietrovischia. I will just finish this one with a photo of my two awesome cats: Maria Jo\u0102\u0141o (right) and Sborra (left)           Sborra             Maria Jo\u0102\u0141o        So, here I am: it is FridayÂ night, technically already Saturday, since time is 00:42 in Geneva (CERN) timezone, and I am awake. Pretty normal, for a Friday night, uh? Thing is, I am not partying, nor am IÂ relaxing at home: I am in the control room of the CMS detector, to monitor that everything is OK, by looking every few seconds at 8 27\u2033 computer screens. I can do some very light work, but nothing that might prevent me from looking at monitor screens every few seconds. The LHC collider accelerates proton beams in two opposite directions across a circle, and makes them cross in a few points. The conventional name of those points is simply P(number): since in those points the beams collide, the detectors that enable us to detect the products of those collisions are situated precisely in those points. CMS, the experiment I work in, has built the detector in P5. The photo shows the physical location of CMS (the one circled in blackÂ in the top right corner) and of the main CERN complex (the one you usually mean when you say \u201cI visited CERN\u201d, which also includes the hostel for visitors \u2013 the one circled in blackÂ in the lower left corner). Near to this last one, you might notice the Geneva International Airport, and the lake. The circles have labels in Italian, because that is the screenshot I sent to my parentsÂ to explain them Â the location of the detector compared to the location of the CERN hostel. Having a large particle physics detector running is not an elementary task: the detector is constituted by hundreds of subsystems, and in order to have all those subsystems to work well together there is a huge shitload of monitoring and tuning to do. For a system of this complexity, the tuning is not something you do once and for all, but it is more of a continuous task, made of tests and slight adjustments. Consequently, to monitor the outcome of all the tests and to ensure everything is working more or less smoothly (and to eventually fix what is not working properly), we need to have 24/7 some people watching at monitoring screens and performing various actions: these people are called shifters. The funny thing is that you can stalkÂ watch us all the timeÂ via the webcams that are installed and always active. The photo is a screenshot I took a few minutes ago to freeze the action. Starting from the guy to the extreme right, the DAQ (Data AcQuisition) shifter, whose job is to start and stop data taking (the run) and activate/deactivate different parts of the detector, depending on the requests by the responsibles of the subsystems. In the center, in a very very relaxed posture and circled in red, you can see yours truly, on Trigger shift.Â We have an enormous amountÂ of collisions per second, but most of them are only partial collisions that do not produce the kind of processes we are interested in: we are interested in very hard collisions. Imagine two trucks passing very close to each other, such that theirÂ lateral mirrors bump and crash into each other, leaving a few broken glass and plastic pieces. Then imagine two trucks bumping head on into each other, leaving the full crashed wreck on the road. We are interested in the full impact scenario: we need a way of deciding if we are interested in any given event, and we need to decide it fast. Furthermore, each collision generates an event in our detector: the event is made of all the activation signals of the various subsystems of the detector, so it is something that needs quite some space to be stored (10MB if I remember correctly \u2013 it\u2019s now 1:14 AM and the systems are all green). You know when you buy a hard disk looking at the speed of the disk (if you are a gamer, you pay a lot of attention to that)? It\u2019s the same: the rate (i.e. the number per second) of events that we can store is limited by the speed of our processing units and storage devices. To make the story short, we can store something like 1000 events per second, and for each event we check if there are specific objects (muons, electrons, jets, etc.) to decide if the event is worth keeping: each of the systems checking a single object is called a trigger,Â and the list of all triggers at any given time (around 200-300) is called trigger menu. The trigger shifter mainly looks at the list of detector components that are activated, compares it with the list of triggers that are firing (i.e. deciding to keep a particular event), and checks that the rates (the number of events per second that fire each trigger) are consistent with the status of the detector. For example, now there are a proton beam and a lead beam in the accelerator, but they are not made to collide at P5, this night: since there are no collisions, but the beams are passing inside the detector, I expect to have some noise in a few triggers, to have ~600 random fires per second, and to have exactly zero rate in all triggers that search for very energetic objects (that would leave strong signals in the detector). If now I saw that suddenly a jet trigger starts firing as if we had energetic jets of particles coming from hard collisions, I would immediately notify the guy to my left with the white sweater (Sasha Nikitenko, an awesome physicist and a very good colleague), which is the shift leader, i.e. the coordinator of the whole shift crew, and then most likely call the HCAL DOC (Hadronic CALorimeter Detector On-Call): DOCs are experts specialized in single subsystems (in this case, the hadronic calorimeter, that is intimately connected with hadronic jets activity). They are not usually all the time at P5, but they must be reachable by phone at any given time, and be able to arrive at P5 in maximum 20 minutes, should the need arise. Fortunately for them, usually issues can be solved with a phone call plus some online work. During periods of heavy detector testing activity, or of physics collisions, many DOCs are very often at P5 in the room with us, to follow things closer. Between me and Sasha, there is another guyÂ that in the photo is partially\u2026 01:31 \u2013 TWINMUX yellow for a couple seconds, back to green again with no action needed Sorry, I had to put a note in the electronic log that summarizes my shift. \u2026so, partially covered by Sasha there is the DQM (Data Quality Monitoring) shifter: he looks mainly at plots that show which part of each subsystem isÂ giving a signal, and to summary histograms of various quantities. He must spot inconsistencies, and report them to make sure any issue is then corrected. Last but not least, at the far left there is the DCS (Detector Control System) shifter, also known as the Lonely Guy, because he sitsÂ at the opposite side of the room, rarely interacts with the Shift Leader, and practically never interacts with the other shifters. DAQ and Trigger shifters interact quite often, because they need to signal to each other the start and end of each run, and sometimes the trigger shifter spots issues that must be solved by the DAQ shifter by resetting some subsystem. The shift leader interacts with everyone, because it is his job \u0111Ÿ˜€ Why did I choose to be the trigger shifter, when a couple of years ago I started taking detectorÂ shifts (which is mandatory in the CMS collaboration)? Half of the reason was that, at the time, I did not know anythingÂ about triggers apart from basic things, so I wanted to gain knowledgeÂ in that. The other half of the reason is\u2026. ehem\u2026 honestly\u2026 that the trigger shifter is the one that has under his direct control the largest number of computer screens (eight of them), and I am kind of a freak ofÂ large computer screens \u0111Ÿ˜€ The last very very important element is\u2026 the coffee machine room, where you can purchase some comfort food and some drinks, especially coffee (the fuel of high energy physics\u2026): why is this needed? Well,Â you must know how long will I stay here, this night. Shifts are organized in three tranches. 7AM to 3PM, 3PM to 11PM, and finally the one I am taking these weekends: the 11PM-7AM one, which is called (officially, as you can see in the screenshot)\u2026 THE OWL SHIFT. Photo: Mark Broadhurst, released under CC0 license Today I had a very full day. It started with a working meeting (an informal meeting of the people working on some analysis) for planning how to improve the EWkino analysis (one of the searches for new physics we are involved in) with the new data CMS is taking. I then went on to the UniOvi CMS group weekly meeting, in which we all meet in the large common office (plus some people connected in videoconference from CERN) to discuss the various topics the group is involved it. Let me delay to another occasion my rant on the amount of CMS meetings we are subjected to! Then, after some quick and frenetic coding work, I had lunch, and a meeting with the three new students that are going to spend the next months working for their BSc with us. Finally, I got out of the office at 5 PM, which is very unusually early: how comes it had been a full day? Well, today was the European Researchers Night, so I got out of the office bringing the group\u2019s diffusion cloud chamber, that is a very simple particle detector designed to visualize the passage of ionizing particles through a stream of condensation bubbles in a small chamber filled up with alcohol in vapor form. The bottom of the chamber is cooled to roughly -35° C, and the temperature gradient with respect to the top of the chamber (that is at ambient temperature) creates a supersaturated vapor environment in the region of the chamber near the bottom. When an ionizing particle (an energetic charged particle, usually coming from the interaction of a primary cosmic ray \u2014 coming from the stars \u2014 with the higher Earth atmosphere) passes through the supersaturated vapor, it ionizes it, and the ions work as condensation centers for the gas: a quantity of small liquid bubbles form across the trajectory of the ionizing particle, enabling us to see its trajectory with our eye. If you want to build your own simple cloud chamber, don\u2019t hesitate: do it, it\u2019s actually pretty simple!!! From the right: Pablo, Francisco, Miguel, Javier, me I was in charge of the stand of Cielos Despejados (Clear Skies), an outreach association I am part of, devoted to the observation of the sky with the association\u2019s telescope and to scientific dissemination about the cosmos. Being also a representative of the UniOviHEP group, I brought also the cloud chamber, and mounted it in the stand in the cloister of the nice historical building of the Universidad de Oviedo. Our stand was the one in the red circle. The photo to the right was taken from the Tower of the building, where we had mounted the association\u2019s telescope, with the plan of attaching a camera to it, and transmitting the signal to the stand below, that was equipped with a very large TV screen. Unfortunately, we had huge network issues, and rain started pouring down, so we had to climb down and bring the telescope to the stand, which implied having a very limited field of view: we actually spent the night having visitors look \u2014 through the telescope, to the watch mounted on top of the tower. In the photo, you can see the mechanism driving the tower watch! Photo credit: trisquel.info We decided to use the TV screen to project with a computer the simulation of the sky provided by the very nice software Stellarium, which is a very powerful and flexible planetarium software with many cool functionalities. Plus, it\u2019s free software, released under the GNU license (in the photo, Richard Stallman being happy)!!!     At this point, Miguel (a first year student from the BSc course in physics) took the microphone and started explaining to the visitors (lots of children!!!) a lot of things about the observable sky using the Stellarium simulation (as the real sky was covered by a thick layer of clouds, plus the rain). I swear: he talked for almost three hours without stopping for a second! He was amazing!!! After an hour or so, when the light started to fade, I finally mounted the cloud chamber: I had to wait, because even if the interior of the chamber is illuminated, it is a bit difficult to observe the bubbly traces if there is too much light in the surroundings. In the photo, you can see the bubble chamber, and the TV screen with Stellarium. The chamber is connected, through a pump and some tubes, to a bucket filled with water and ice: this has the double purpose of giving the chamber\u2019s internal Peltier cell a low starting temperature, and dissipating the heat produced by the Peltier cell (a Peltier cell is a thermoelectric devise that is used to cool things down, at the price of heating up the rest of the device). The Peltier cell is the responsible for lowering the temperature in the bottom of the bucket to -35° C. While I was still mounting the chamber, a lot of children stormed by, asking what I was doing, and what was that lighted up device, so I briefly explained them the purpose of the device and the way it worked, but had to tell them to stop by at a later time for actually seeing the chamber in action: this is because the device needs to heat up before reaching the working regime (it takes about half an hour). At some point, I was able to shoot a brief video of the chamber in action, and you can watch it below! Most of the tracks are from muons (in the volume of the chamber, we expect about 3-4 muons per second), then there are a few electrons (often seen as V-shaped tracks: what happens there is that a photon enters the chamber, invisible, and then converts into two electrons, thus generating the V-shaped bubble tracks. In the short time span of the video, I don\u2019t remember having seen any alpha particles passing by: these are helium nuclei, hence heavier, larger, slower, with more charge than the electrons or muons; this implies that they ionize more the alcohol gas, and so their passage would be announced by a very thick (up to ~1 cm) bubbles stream).   Cool, isn\u2019t it? People were very responsive to the instrument and the explanation of its inner workings! The cool thing of the European Researchers Night in Oviedo is that lots of families with small children tag along! Some children even spent the night going in groups from stand to stand to work on assignments from their school teachers!!! I think this is super cool!!! Two or three groups actually even requested to record my description of the experiment, for their later processing: of course I accepted, but when people are recording you then you have always this lingering tension\u2026 Then there was this kid that asked for all the details, and then asked my informed opinion on whether it would be easy to build a replica of the cloud chamber in the open, in the middle of a grass field, and did not stop until I explained him thoroughly why it would be unattainable. Then, a girl asked me how you decide your research field «among all the cool things you can do in physics and mathematics», which is very awesome! I gave her a few examples of some friends I have and mine, and finally encouraged her to pursue whatever field provides the most fun to her! And finally, the super-cool event of the night: a girl, seemingly about 7 or 8 years old, listened to the cloud chamber explanation, asked a few questions to understand better a few details (children are smart! They always ask the best questions!). Then she remained silent some 10 seconds, intently watching the cloud chamber, with this serious and critic facial expression. Finally, she looked up, nodded solemnly,  and very-very-seriously said: «Es chulo!» (It\u2019s cool!), and marched away, leaving me utterly flabbergasted. Because this, ladies and gentlemen, is ultimately why we do science, and why we crawl out of our offices to show the science to you. Because it\u2019s fun, and chulo.
