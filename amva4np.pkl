V If you were to visit www.cern.ch, and click on \u201cAbout CERN\u201d you would find the following text. It is written so well that there would be no point in re-expressing the same idea. So here it is: The CERN logo. \u201cFounded in 1954, the CERN laboratory sits astride the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva. It was one of Europe\u2019s first joint ventures and now has 21 member states. The name CERN is derived from the acronym for the French \u201cConseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire\u201d, or European Council for Nuclear Research, a provisional body founded in 1952 with the mandate of establishing a world-class fundamental physics research organization in Europe. At that time, pure physics research concentrated on understanding the inside of the atom, hence the word \u201cnuclear\u201d.  Today, our understanding of matter goes much deeper than the nucleus, and CERN\u2019s main area of research is particle physics \u2013 the study of the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting between them. Because of this, the laboratory operated by CERN is often referred to as the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.\u201d A lot of water has flown under the bridge since the 50s. By now, CERN is the world\u2019s premier particle physics laboratory, and the celebrated setting of the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, which includes four experiments. The two large, \u201cgeneral-purpose\u201d experiments, ATLAS and CMS, aim to study all characteristics of the proton-proton collisions offered by CERN. The LHC and its four experiments: ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, and LHCb. The best-known discoveries of experiments at CERN are (a) neutral currents in the 70s by Gargamelle (b) the W and Z bosons of electroweak theory in the 80s, by UA1 and UA2 and (c) the Higgs boson, the last element of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, in 2012, by ATLAS and CMS. Over the past thirty years, CERN experiments have made seminal contributions in establishing the \u201cStandard Model\u201d into the \u201cStandard Theory\u201d of particle physics. All in parallel with creating technology, amongst which the invention of the World-Wide Web, the ubiquitous www, in the 90s. Nowadays, the LHC represents the \u201cenergy frontier\u201d in particle physics \u2013 the place where, traditionally, new physics has been showing up throughout the past hundred years. The LHC experiments are trying to answer \u201cnext-gen\u201d questions such as \u201cwhat stabilizes the mass of the Higgs boson\u201d? Incredibly, if one goes through the mathematics of a particle that would have all the properties of the Higgs boson (and thus give mass to all the other particles) one realizes that the mass of this particle should be infinite \u2013 or whatever comes close to infinity. Yet, infinite it is not, for it has been discovered at a very finite mass of ~130 protons. Is there some new mechanism in nature that cancels this infinity? Or, perhaps this new entity, the Higgs boson, a particle like no other, for it has the characteristics of the vacuum, can \u201csee\u201d and \u201cfeel\u201d into hidden worlds like dark matter? Could it be a portal into this mysterious form of matter that keeps galaxies from flying apart, and, most importantly, seems to be necessary for the very formation of the galaxies in our universe? The hunt goes on. CMS and ATLAS just started operating at the new energy frontier of 13 TeV, looking for the unknown. This \u201clook\u201d is complicated: there are billions of events to sift through, hundreds of characteristics to look for. And many Standard Model processes that are produced much more copiously than the new posited physics. In this battle, for a battle it is, the experiments are trying to employ the latest greatest tools. Thus the involvement in the AMVA4NewPhysics ITN, which is funded by the European Commission\u2019s Marie Curie Program. CERN is participating in AMVA4NewPhysics with three components \u2013 an unprecedented feat: one group is working on the CMS experiment and is carrying out searches for new physics, including \u201cSupersymmetry\u201d and \u201cDark Matter\u201d. A second group is working on the ATLAS experiment and is studying methods of increasing the precision of measurements of the top quark. A third group is working on theoretical particle physics and in particular extensions of the Standard Model. Each one of these groups will be hiring an \u201cESR\u201d (EC-ese for \u201cEarly Stage Researcher\u201d, meaning \u201csomeone with a Master\u2019s degree, and no more than four years away from the award of this degree\u201d) to work on these hot topics. May the fun begin. Well, \u201ccontinue\u201d, is actually a more appropriate term. (Written by P. Sphicas) A new Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position in the network has opened up at Technical University Munich (TUM). Different from the experimentally oriented ESR positions we have filled so far in the network, TUM is offering a three-year Ph.D. position in theoretical physics. The ESR will be involved in searches for New Physics and their implications for Physics beyond the Standard Model. The main goal will be the application of the relevant tools in searches for new physics manifesting itself in new particles, like supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model or non-Standard Model Higgs signals. In particular, the ESR will work on the reinterpretation of advanced searches within a public recasting framework. Of course also in this case, a very rich training programme is foreseen for the ESR. It includes the participation in several international doctoral schools, workshops and conferences. In addition, there will be two visiting periods to two of the partner institutions of the network, UCL Louvain in Belgium and to the heart of particle physics, CERN. The ESR will also be given the opportunity to get to know the world outside of research during a three-month secondment at a network partner with expertise in applications of Machine Learning tools.

Feature image taken from https://www.tefl-iberia.com Four years ago, the Higgs boson was officially declared an established subnuclear particle. With that announcement, an over 40 years long search finally reached its conclusion. But that day, July 4th 2012, also marked the start of a new epoch: the one of Higgs boson studies. What we know about the Higgs boson, four years into the Higgs studies era, is a lot. We know, for instance, that its mass is of 125 GeV, give or take less than half a GeV. We are quite confident that it has null spin and positive parity, as expected by the Standard Model. And we know that the particle does decay similarly to what we predict. However, there is much more that we still do not yet know about the newest elementary particle in town. We have founded reasons to believe that the Standard Model is not complete, and that it needs to be expanded to be consistent. So, as all other attempts have failed to provide hints of new physics, maybe it is through Higgs boson physics that we will eventually glimpse at what lies beyond. The 2016 data taking curve is the steep yellow one.  The Large Hadron Collider is delivering 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at an increased pace to the ATLAS and CMS experiments this year (see figure to the right: the 2016 data taking curve is the steep yellow one), and physicists are ready to look at the resulting new datasets to further improve our knowledge of the Higgs. Personally, one of the things I will be very happy to see with the new data is an improved measurement of the natural width of the Higgs boson. What is the natural width? It is a fundamental property of elementary as well as composite subnuclear particles, determining the speed of their disintegration. The larger the width, the faster is the decay of the particle. If we measure the Higgs boson width and find out it is larger than what the Standard Model predicts, that would be an indirect, but very clean proof of the existence of new physics in the phenomenology of the Higgs boson: it would imply that new, that is yet unknown particles can \u201ccouple\u201d to the Higgs boson, making its decay faster than expected. Curiously, we can measure the Higgs boson width despite the fact that it is very small. The predicted value is just 4 MeV \u2013 a thirty-thousandth of its mass value. If we had an infinite precision detector we could measure it directly by looking at the spread of masses of the Higgs bosons we find in the data; unfortunately, the resolution on the Higgs mass is over 100 times larger than the natural width, so that kind of measurement is undoable. It\u2019s just as if you wanted to measure the thickness of a human hair with a ruler. Good luck with it. What comes to our rescue is that finite width effects in the Higgs boson width manifest themselves at high mass. The Higgs boson often decays to a pair of Z bosons, and one of the two is forced to have a mass quite smaller than its nominal value (as the Z mass is 91 GeV and the Higgs weighs 125 GeV, one of the two Z bosons needs to be \u201coff mass-shell\u201d for the decay to take place). Now, particles do not like to be off mass-shell -they like to \u201cresonate\u201d at their correct mass value. So the resonance shape of the Higgs boson gets deformed by the relative probability of the Z bosons to be far, or less far, from their own nominal mass. You can check for yourself the effect in the graph below. Cross section versus invariant mass for Higgs decay to four leptons (red) compared to background processes. While the signal is larger than the backgrounds only around 125 GeV, there is a significant contribution at high masses, due to the top-pair hump.  As you see, rather than just a narrow peak at 125 GeV, the Higgs mass distribution (red curve) has this funny tail at high mass; not only is there this turn-on-like enhancement at 182 GeV \u2013 twice the Z mass: there is also a further enhancement at twice the top quark mass, due to the same kind of effect. The Higgs would love it to decay to a top-antitop quark pair, and so the very fact that a top-antitop pair is a possible decay final state if the Higgs has a mass of 350 GeV enhances the probability that a Higgs boson gets such a unnaturally high mass value. The reader (yes, the only one who survived up to this point of this post) be warned: the above is a simplification. In truth the resonance shape is created by subtle interference effects, and it is by no means trivial to understand. However, the basic points outlined above give an idea of the reason of the funny multi-humped structure. For an experimentalist, the shape gives a chance to search for off mass-shell Higgs bosons, and from their presence or absence an indirect measurement of the Higgs boson width can be extracted, as the width crucially affects the actual mass shape. I do hope that ATLAS and CMS will present updates on their width measurements at ICHEP 2016, an international conference which will take place in Chicago in August.That would certainly be a great new contribution to Higgs physics. While selection for the position at TUM is still ongoing, the call for the last Early Stage Researcher (ESR) position of the network has now been published by IASA, the Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications, at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) in Greece. The selected candidate will be enrolled in the three-year Ph.D. program offered by the Department of Physics of the University of Athens.  Besides following mandatory courses of the PhD programme, the ESR will participate in the research program of AMVA4NewPhysics, performing data analysis in collaboration with members of the CMS experiment from IASA and the University of Athens. The NKUA\u2019s CMS group is currently active in searches for Supersymmetry/Dark matter and also Exotic new physics. The ESR\u2019s research will focus on the development of algorithms for signature-specific new physics searches in Run II with CMS data.  In addition to the research activities, a rich training programme is foreseen for the ESR. It includes the participation in several international doctoral schools, workshops and conferences. The ESR will also spend two months in Padua to work with members of the INFN and the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padua, one month at Université Blaise Pascal Clermont-Ferrand II to document the report on the application of statistical learning methods for model dependent and model-independent searches for new Physics, three months of secondment in SDG Consulting S.p.A. in Milan to work on applications of topological and geometric multi-scale analysis, and two months at CERN to interact with the CMS Exotica physics group and finalize the analysis of Run II data. The ESR will be hired with a 30-month full-time contract at IASA, with the option of an additional 6 months financed solely by NKUA/IASA. The gross salary amounts to 2883 Euro per month; this will be subject to insurance and tax withholdings (depending on the candidate\u2019s profile). In addition, a gross mobility allowance of 600 euro per month is provided for, as well as a gross family allowance of euro 500 per month if applicable. All expenses related to travel to schools, workshops, and network-organized events will be planned and sustained by the network. The ESR will be provided with office space at IASA and access to a cluster of computers for his or her research work. The deadline of the call is December 23, 2016! For the eligibility criteria and details on the application you can refer to the call. Some time ago I participated to a TV show organized by a producer of programs for local television channels, LP network. The program is titled \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d and its anchorman, Carlo Savergnago, invited me together with a high-school teacher, Paola Zocca, to discuss the Italian school system and the challenge of helping students find and enhance their natural talents. Of course I do not consider myself an expert of that topic, but I believe I was able to give my own perspective on the matter, at least as far as the teaching of scientific disciplines is concerned. The discussion was not very deep, as the format of the show did not allow to spend much time on details. Maybe the most interesting point that was raised during the discussion was a question I ended up asking myself to the anchor. In the assumption that the development of a student\u2019s talent is not necessarily the path that is going to bring her more happiness and fulfilment in her life, Â and instead some different study and career path could be the one that brings her more personal satisfaction and happiness, what is really the best choice ? In other words, should we pursue the career path which best exploits our potential, or the one which brings us more satisfaction ? It is generally assumed that success -and the resultingÂ feeling of personal fulfilment- is perfectly aligned with one\u2019s happiness. But this needs not be so: there are kids who are raised from a very young age to be piano players, or to play golf or tennis, or what have you, but are they always happy with that ? I suspect that having their career path figured out by somebody else from the start is a simplification, but may hide some dark sides. Anyway \u2013 the video linked below is in Italian, so I guess it will not be of any use or entertainment to you. I put it here just for the record. On the other hand if you care to listen to it and have an opinion on these matters, I will be happy to read you below!     How is it possible to isolate the signal of the double Higgs production using the decay channel in which each boson decays into a pair of b-quarks? Which is the best classification model that can help us in separating the signal from background? In my master thesis I propose a Bayesian model that can be used instead of the common classification techniques, like Random Forest (RF), Boosting Decision Tree (BDT) or Gradient Boosting (GB). In particular, I chose a Bayesian nonparametric approach. I started out by estimating a Bayesian model in which the prior distributions of the parameters are given by a stochastic process known as Dirichlet Process. Intuitively, a Dirichlet process is a probability distribution and every extraction from it is itself a probability distribution. More formally, it is possible to define the Dirichlet Process as an infinite mixture of random variables extracted from a base distribution, named : Given then , where  is a point of mass concentrated in  and  is the beta distribution with parameters  and . That definition is known as stick-breaking and it has a simple interpretation: consider a stick of length 1 and generate a random variable . Then, break off the stick at  and define  as the length of the stick on the left. Subsequently, take the stick to the right, and generate , break off the stick and obtain . And so on. In order to improve the performance of the model, I introduced interactions between variables. In a more flexible way, I also introduced nonlinear relationships between the response variable and the explanatory available variables as a new component to the model. So, I combined the Dirichlet process with a Bayesian tree (BART) and Bayesian penalized splines (P-splines) and I fitted the following model: where  is the probability of signal,  is fitted by a Dirichlet Process, with atoms distributed as sum of Bayesian trees, and the functions  are fitted using Bayesian -splines. It turned out that the most performing model was the one which exclusively combines BART and -splines: where the functions  are fitted using Bayesian -splines and the \u2018s are fitted using Bayesian trees. In Fig. 1 ROC curves of the most important models are represented and in Table 1 you can see some performance indicators of the fitted model obtained on a test set: they show that the performance of the Bayesian nonparametric approach can be considered as good as the performance of the Random Forest. Fig. 1: ROC curves of the most important models. Table 1: Performance indicators of the fitted model The AMVA4NewPhysics network is completing its hiring of ten Early-Stage Researchers, who will do research in ATLAS or CMS and obtain a Ph.D. at the end of a three-year period. So far we hired six bright young guys and gals (they have been blogging here for a while now, so if you dig in the past articles in this blog you will find their presentation), and four more are going to be hired in the forthcoming four months. As AMVA4NewPhysics is declaredly sensitive to the issue of gender balance in Science, we have inserted in all our calls for applications a special encouragement for the application of female students. And so far we are extremely satisfied both with the level of our trainees, as well as with the fact that we have a perfect gender balance in the pool: 3 males and 3 females! This is very unusual in our field of research, so we are very, very proud of it. Also, it is one promise we made to our funding agent \u2013 the Horizon2020 program of the EU \u2013 so for us this is twice as important. Currently there is one open call, for a position at the Université Blaise Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand. The student hired there will work under the advisory of prof. Julien Donini, performing searches for new physics with ATLAS data. For more information and the application form, please visit this site. Three more calls will soon open (for ESR positions at CERN, TUM, and IASA), so if you are interested be sure to keep watching both this space, and the AMVA4NewPhysics web page. It would be advisable to follow the blog as we plan to import the contents of the web page here \u2013 it makes little sense to maintain both. (Featured image credit: CERN) The fifth edition of the IN2P3 School Of Statistics gives an overview of the concepts and tools used in particle physics, astro-particle physics and cosmology when probabilities and statistics come to play. In particular, this edition is dedicated to the use of multivariate discriminants in the framework of data analyses performed in collider physics. This school is targeted both towards PhD students and senior physicists, aiming at extending their knowledge and skills in the field of statistical tools and frameworks developed for their fields. The school takes place in Autrans at \u201cL\u2019Escandille\u201d from Monday May 30th to Friday June 3rd 2016. \u201cL\u2019Escandille\u201d (image credit: http://www.escandille.com/) The lectures are subdivided into three parts: one reminding the fundamental concepts used in Probabilities, Statistics and Hypothesis testing applied to physics analysis; a part focusing on the presentation of the concept and basis of most popular multivariate techniques and used in data analyses; and a part dedicated to actual multivariate tools and frameworks dedicated to data analyses in High energy Physics. All lectures will be given in English. This year two lecturers (Tommaso Dorigo and Julien Donini) and one student (Giles Strong) will come from the AMVA4NewPhysics network. If you are interested come join us at the school, registrations are still open! The AMVA4NewPhysics members at CERN have recently opened the call to hire their second ESR after Anna Stakia, who you have recently met on this blog. The new ESR\u2019s work will focus on Higgs physics with modern statistical learning tools. The main goal is an improved classification of Higgs production in association with top quarks via the matrix element method. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of new matrix element tools and to the analysis of ATLAS data using proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV produced by the LHC collider at CERN. Of course, also in this case a rich training program is waiting on the successful candidate: three one-month visits to other members of the network (the physics departments of LIP in Lisbon, Portugal, and UCL in Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium, and the Institute for Mathematics for Analysis and Applications, EPFL, in Lausanne, Switzerland. In addition, the ESR will be trained on the development of supervised training software in a three-month secondment at the industrial partner B12-Consulting in Louvain-La-Neuve. The CERN ESR positions are special in some way, since they consist of 2-year contracts and don\u2019t come with a PhD position attached. This way they offer a great opportunity to enthusiastic and talented students or young professionals who are thinking of doing a doctorate \u2013 or even have already started a doctorate in the ATLAS experiment in an area related to the topics in AMVA4NewPhysics. Sounds interesting? Then come check out the call on the CERN website and send your application! Hi there, my name is Giovanna Menardi, I\u2019m a researcher at the Department of Statistical Sciences of University of Padua, and PI of one node of the AMVA4NewPhysics network. The Department where most of our activities are being carried on has a pretty long history. It was one of the very first departments to be established at the University of Padua, rooted in the \u201cGabinetto di Statistica\u201d, which was originally instituted in 1889. The garden of the Department of Statistical Sciences. It was set up with the aim of concentrating all the University\u2019s resources related to Statistics and its application under one roof. This commitment is still our main objective as witnessed by the fact that it is currently one of the very few Departments uniquely specialized in Statistical Sciences left in Italy. It has been placed within the historical building of the former \u201cMonastero di Santa Caterina d\u2019Alessandria\u201d, it stretches over a total area of 4,389 square meters all situated around a large garden and consists of eight lecture rooms,  a large departmental library and three computer laboratories, open for individual study and for classes. The Department hosts about 40 people among professors and researchers, 25 PhD students and 4/5 Post-Docs. It currently offers two undergraduate programmes in Statistics and one graduate programme in Statistical Sciences with five different specializations. Ultimate excellence in education is reached within the Doctoral Programme in Statistics. Besides me, there are a few other persons involved in the network from the University of Padua. You\u2019ve already gotten to know Greg, our ESR who is currently enrolled in the PhD programme in Statistical  Sciences offered by the Department. This node could not go on without Bruno Scarpa, who is associate professor in Statistics, research participant and, together with me, scientific supervisor of Greg. His research interests mostly focus on Bayesian Nonparametric methods, but he is also an expert on data mining tools. Livio Finos is a further participant of the project. He was formerly researcher at the Department of Statistical Science and is currently associate professor at the Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation. He is an expert on multiple testing, perhaps one of the statistical topics of greatest interest in HEP analysis to corroborate some hypothesis of interest. And finally a few words about myself: so far, I\u2019ve concentrated my research activity on computational statistics and multivariate data analysis. My favourite research topic is clustering, and in particular the nonparametric formulation of the density-based approach. As you\u2019ll have understood we are the odd one out of the network, in fact, with expertise more in \u201cAMVA\u201d, than in \u201cNew Physics\u201d! Working within the network is a great challenge for us, and we hope to give our contribution. (Written by G. Menardi) Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world. The university existed in some form already in 1096 but it started developing rapidly in 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. Oxford has educated many notable alumni including 27 Nobel laureates, 26 British prime ministers and many foreign heads of state. The University is composed by academic departments, research centres, libraries and museums. In addition, there are also 38 colleges (many dating back to the 13th century), and six permanent halls, which are independent from the university, but also deeply connected to it. Within the colleges the students are taught by faculty in groups of one to three on a weekly basis, in what is called the tutorial system. The university and college system are beneficial to both faculty and students, providing the advantage of belonging both to a large, internationally renowned institution and to a small, interdisciplinary academic community. Physics at Oxford did not have an easy path. In the seventeenth century, the department of Experimental Philosophy, as physics was then known as in Oxford, was honoured with the presence of two physicists whose names are remembered to the present day: Robert Boyle and his assistant Robert Hooke. Nonetheless, after that, many of the leaders of the physics department did not have any interest in research. The original Clarendon Laboratory, the first purpose-built physics laboratory in the UK, was mainly a teaching facility. The turning point in Oxford physics came in 1919 with the appointment of Lindemann as head of the Clarendon Laboratory, who built up the physics department. Currently, the Oxford Physics Department is one of the largest physics departments in the world, employing about 475 people and having an annual turnover of about £33m. The members of the AMVA4NewPhysics team in Oxford are part of the ATLAS collaboration. Oxford is one of the founding members of the ATLAS experiment and made major contributions to the design, prototyping, construction, and commissioning of the detector, and in particular of the Semiconductor Tracker barrels, which were assembled in the basement of the Denys Wilkinson Building. The ATLAS group consists of 10 academics, 5 postdocs, 9 graduate students, several engineers and IT support. The group analysis effort focuses on searches for New Physics beyond the Standard Model, understanding the properties of the Higgs boson, and Standard Model precision measurements. In AMVA4NewPhysics we aim at developing and applying novel statistical learning techniques to Higgs decays to two b-jets (H\u2192bb) and to studies of di-Higgs production in 4 b-jets final states (HH\u2192bbbb). The author of this article, Daniela Bortoletto, is a professor at Oxford and the coordinator of WP1 in AMVA4NewPhysics. She is also a senior Kurti Fellow in Brasenose College. (Written by D. Bortoletto) I attended the second Future Circular Collider (FCC) week that took place in Rome from 11 to 15Â April. It was a very interesting event, covering amazing physics reach and important technological developments. Many studies have been conducted to establish the physics reach of several accelerators that could be hosted in a new 100 km tunnel passing under lake Geneva. The FCC-ee machine will operate at different center-of-mass energies to produce unprecedented amounts of Z, W, and Higgs bosons. This will allow to measure the decays of these particles with incredible precision and hopefully to find shortcomings in the standard model. The FCC-hh machine will reach energies of 100 TeV and allow direct searches of new physics particles with masses up to 10 TeV. It will also allow the measurement of the Higgs self couplings. The combination of the two machines is simply phenomenal. A future 100 TeV proton-proton collider relies on the use of magnets with a nominal field of 16 Tesla, almost double compared to the 8 Tesla of the LHC superconducting magnets. Niobium-Tin (Nb3Sn) can sustain the current densities required to reach these high fields, but it is brittle and very expensive. Nonetheless, the program is advancing well and the latest breakthrough occurred in the summer of 2015 at CERN, when a Nb3Sn magnet in RMC (Racetrack Model Coil) configuration reached the 16.2 Tesla mark. New superconducting materials like Nb3Sn are developed and tested as they can meet the requirements of a 16 Tesla magnet for a FCC. I found incredibly interesting a presentation by Massimo Florio on the cost-benefit analysis of the LHC. The team that Florio assembled has concluded that there is a more than 90% chance that the LHC benefits outweigh the costs of construction and operation, taking into account the economic, educational and cultural benefits generated during its time of operation. The impact includes the development of new technologies, the training of doctoral students and young researchers, and cultural and major scientific breakthroughs. (Written by D. Bortoletto)   My first post in this blog was about the use of Multivariate Analysis (MVA) to enhance the discrimination between signal and background processes in Higgs pair production in the final state with four bottom quarks. I would like now to discuss another very important application of MVAs, namely the unbiased parametrization of unknown multi-dimensional physical quantities. In the case at hand now, these quantities are the parton distribution functions of the proton, or PDFs for short. A crucial aspect of the physics program at the LHC is based on providing accurate theoretical predictions for all relevant processes such as Higgs production or Standard Model benchmark cross-sections. An important ingredient of these predictions are the proton PDFs, which encode the dynamics determining how the energy of the protons that collide at the LHC is split among its fundamental constituents, the quarks and gluons. As opposed to lepton colliders, where the center-of-mass energy of the collision is fixed by the lepton beam energy, at hadron colliders only the hadronic center-of-mass energy is known beforehand, from the energy of the proton beams. But protons, unlike electrons, are not fundamental quantities, and are composed by quarks and gluons. Therefore, the LHC more than a proton collider is a quark and gluon collider. This implies that to determine the outcome of any LHC collision, and to know which is the partonic center-of-mass energy, we need to know how the energy of the colliding protons is shared among quarks and gluons. The bad news is that PDFs are intrinsically non-perturbative objects, and thus their computation from first principles in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD, the theory of the strong interaction) is so far out of reach (aside: despite the claims that the Standard Model is a well-understood theory, this is very far from true. For instance, we have no clue about why the proton, one of the most common particles in the universe, has the mass it has. And no, it is (mostly) unrelated to the Higgs mechanism, since the proton mass arises from non-perturbative QCD dynamics). Therefore, PDFs need to be extracted from experimental data, using the so-called global analysis framework. This requires combining many different measurements with state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations and a robust statistical methodology, in order to construct PDF sets that meet the requirements of the LHC phenomenology. Given our limited understanding of non-perturbative QCD dynamics, the shape of the parton distributions xfi(x,Q20) at the input parametrization scale Q0 (which is typically of the same order of the proton mass) should be as general as possible, ensuring that it is flexible enough to be able to describe all experimental data included in the fit. Here, we denote by x the fraction of the total proton momentum carried by each quark and gluon in the proton, and Q2 is the typical energy scale of the partonic collision. In most cases, the following ansatz is adopted, , where i denotes a given quark flavour (or flavour combination) or the gluon. The normalisation fractions Af_i, the exponents af_i and bf_i, and the set of parameters {cf_i} are determined from the data. Some of the Af_i  can be fixed in terms of the other parameters by means of the sum rules, direct predictions of QCD. In addition, the PDF parametrization should implement the kinematic constrain that in the elastic limit xfi(x \u21921,Q20) \u2192 0. Once the PDFs are determined at the initial scaleQ0, their behaviour for any other values of the factorization scale Q is determined via the QCD evolution equations. The crux of the problem is thus how to parametrize the (unknown) dependence of the PDFs in the momentum fraction x. The simplest solution, like the use of low-order polynomials, was adopted in the earlier PDF fits, but it is clear that the use of ad-hoc parametrizations is prone to the introduction of theoretical biases, which would affect the interpretation of the LHC results. With the motivation to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches, we have developed a novel approach to the determination of PDFs based on Machine Learning techniques, the so-called NNPDF approach. In this framework, PDFs learn the underlying physical law from experimental data without the need of imposing any prior knowledge, just as we learn how to score penalty kicks without the need of solving Newton\u2019s equations of motion beforehand. As a representative example of the NNPDF results, in Fig. 1 we show the NNPDF3.0 global analysis of parton distributions, from the Particle Data Group 2016 review. The different quark and gluon PDFs, including their uncertainty bands, are represented at two different values of the resolution scale Q2: higher values of Q2 imply that one is probing the proton at smaller distances. Fig. 1: The NNPDF3.0 global analysis of parton distributions, from the Particle Data Group (PDG) 2016 review. The different quark and gluon PDFs, including their uncertainty bands, are represented at two different values of the resolution scale Q2: higher values of Q2 imply that one is probing the proton at smaller distances. It is beyond the scope of this post to review in detail the complete NNPDF approach, so I will restrict myself to one of its central ingredients, the use of Artificial Neural Networks as universal unbiased interpolants. As I mentioned, the basic problem in PDF fits is how to parametrize the functional dependence of the PDFs in the parton momentum fraction x. In the NNPDF approach, we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to parametrize this dependence. This is motivated by a number of theoretical results that ensure that, given enough neurons in the inner layers, ANNs can reproduce any functional behaviour that is indicated by experimental data, no matter how wobbly or complicated this is. In Fig. 2 we show the schematic representation of an artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. In particular, the NNPDF fits use feed-forward multi-layer neural networks, also known as perceptrons. Fig. 2: Schematic representation of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a single hidden layer. This type of feed-forward multi-layer neural network is also known as a perceptron. A crucial point of the NNPDF procedure is the so called training phase, where the ANN has to learn the underlying physical laws from the experimental measurements. This is achieved by determining a measure of the quality of the agreement between data and theory (for a given set of input PDFs), typically with a \u03c72 estimator, and then using a suitable minimization method to find the parameters that maximize this agreement. In Fig. 3 we show an example of the training phase of an ANN, divided into two steps, the first one when a deterministic minimization algorithm (back-propagation) is used, and the second when a random minimization algorithm is used instead (Genetic Algorithms, or GA for short). The right plot corresponds to a detail of the GA phase. Fig. 3: An example of the training phase of an ANN, divided into two steps, the first one when a deterministic minimization algorithm (back-propagation) is used, and the second when a random minimization algorithm is used instead (Genetic Algorithms, or GA for short). The right plot corresponds to a detail of the GA phase. Genetic Algorithms (which could be the subject of several posts!) are non-deterministic minimization strategies suitable for the solution of complex optimization problems, for instance when a very large number of quasi-equivalent minima are present. GAs are inspired by natural selection processes that emulate biological evolution. The use of ANNs to parametrize PDFs can be shown to have several important advantages. To begin with, results can be shown to be extremely robust to the specific choice of ANN architecture. In a particularly impressive example, NNPDF fits use 2-5-3-1 networks with a total of 37 free parameters each (and there are seven independent PDFs at the input scale Q20). Now, if we increase by a factor 10 the number of parameters in each ANN, to around 400 parameters, the results of the fit are unchanged: this means that PDFs are determined exclusively by data, as they should, and not by our a priory theory bias. Other advantages include a characteristic blow-up of the PDF uncertainties in regions with very limited constraints: this indicates when PDFs stop being trustable for precision physics. This result might seem unremarkable, until one realizes that, if PDFs are parametrized by simple polynomials, the uncertainties in the extrapolation regions will be similar to those of the data region, with potentially worrisome implications on measurements and searches based on these PDFs (since the PDF uncertainty will be artificially smaller than what it should be). This post has attempted to present another application of MVAs in the context of high-energy physics, namely the unbiased parametrization of unknown physical quantities. In a shortly coming post I will discuss why this unbiased parametrization is so crucial for the LHC physics program, and explore the implications in other domains usually thought to be orthogonal to collider physics. In particular, I will discuss the connection between PDFs at very small values of the parton momentum fraction x and the recent discovery by the IceCube experiment of very high energy neutrinos from astrophysical origin.

Major companies (Michelin, Limagrain, Volvic, etc.) contribute to the economic growth of the city, which counts 35,000 students. World capital of short films, Clermont-Ferrand offers a wide variety of cultural events. With such an environment, Blaise Pascal university provides an ideal context for the students that wish to study in one of its major training and research areas: sciences and technologies; literature, languages and arts; human and social sciences; physical and sports activities sciences and techniques. View on the Blaise Pascal university campus as seen from the particle physics laboratory. Created at the beginning of the 1960\u2019s, the Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire (the particle physics laboratory) is located in the heart of the Blaise Pascal university scientific campus, in the physics department. The LPC staff is composed of professors and associate professors, hired by the university, and full-time researchers, engineers and technicians, hired by the french national center for scientific research (CNRS). The main topic of LPC is research in experimental particle physics, mostly with the LHC at CERN (ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb experiments), as well as experimental cosmology (LSST experiment), theoretical research in particle physics and applied research in the physics for health and environment department. In LPC, all members of the AMVA4NewPhysics network are members of the ATLAS collaboration, and the ESR who will be hired will analyse ATLAS data. The ATLAS@LPC team is one of the oldest french ATLAS teams and was actually involved in the design of the LHC experiments even before the ATLAS collaboration existed. The ATLAS detector during the construction phase. I took this picture in April 2006. The team has been working on the hadronic tile calorimeter, mostly on its front-end electronics and its calibration system. Concerning physics, the team has specialised in the study of the use of the top quark, the heaviest elementary particle ever found. Currently, the ATLAS@LPC team contributes significantly to four different physics analyses. The first analysis focuses on the search for the production of a top-quark pair together with a Higgs boson, that would lead to the study of the coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark. The other analyses search for new physics phenomena in events containing top quarks: search for new particles that would decay into one (W\u2019 or heavy charged scalar boson to top-antibottom) or two top quarks (Z\u2019 or heavy neutral scalar boson to top-antitop), search for new physics phenomena (extra spatial dimensions, production of heavy scalar bosons) that would produce four top quarks in the same event. In close connection to these searches, two members of the AMVA4NewPhysics network have been part of the team that developed a software tool for computing limits on poissonian process rates using a hybrid frequentist-bayesian CLs method, OpTHyLiC. (Written by D. Calvet) In an earlier blog post, Tommaso challenged me to write about a new unfolding method I\u2019ve developed together with Philip Stark. Before describing the new method, I should first explain what the unfolding problem is and why it is a tough problem to solve. The problem arises because of the finite resolution of LHC particle detectors. This means that any measurement performed at the LHC is corrupted by a small amount of random noise. For example, when the energy of a particle is measured in a calorimeter, the value might only be accurate to the first decimal place with the rest driven by stochastic noise. Now, imagine measuring a spectrum of these energies. Because of the noisy energy measurements, the spectrum will appear to be \u201cblurred\u201d or \u201csmeared\u201d with respect to the true physical spectrum. The unfolding problem is then to use the smeared spectrum to reconstruct the physical \u201cuncorrupted\u201d spectrum. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: The spectra measured at LHC detectors a blurred versions (left figure) of the actual physical spectra (right figure). The unfolding problem consists in using the blurred spectrum to reconstruct the true physical spectrum. This may sound a bit abstract so far, but we are all familiar with a similar problem from digital photography. Whenever you take a picture with your digital camera, the picture will appear slightly blurred because of imperfections in the optics of the camera. A problem analogous to unfolding is to take this blurred image and to find a way to deblur it in order to recover the underlying sharp image. In fact, we can think of the LHC detectors as extremely complicated digital cameras which take three-dimensional images of particle collisions. The unfolding problem can then be understood as the problem of deblurring the information extracted from these images. It turns out that this problem is a really tough nut to crack. The reason is that there is a very large amount of unfolded spectra, which, within statistical uncertainties, can explain any given smeared spectrum. In mathematical jargon, such problems are called ill-posed inverse problems. What this means in practice is that standard statistical techniques, such as maximum likelihood estimation, tend to give unfolded estimates which make no sense at all, with uncertainties that are way off the scale. The way to overcome these issues is to reduce the amount of possible solutions by using a priori information about physically plausible unfolded spectra. The typical way to introduce a priori information is to require the solutions to be smooth functions. This sounds like a sensible thing to do since typical high energy physics spectra are indeed smooth. Many unfolding techniques currently used in LHC data analysis leverage on this smoothness assumption. The problem with this assumption is, however, that one has to decide how smooth the solution should be. We know that the solution should generally be smooth, but it is very difficult to decide how much smoothness should actually be required. One consequence of this is that it becomes very difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with unfolding that is based on smoothness assumptions. This is indeed a major shortcoming of existing unfolding techniques: it is very difficult to give reliable estimates of their uncertainty. This brings us to my latest work on this problem which I described in a seminar at the University of Padova in December. The key idea of our proposal is to replace the smoothness assumption with assumptions concerning the shape of the unfolded spectrum. These shape constraints can for example concern the positivity, monotonicity, convexity or unimodality of the solution. Such shape assumption are not only an effective way of constraining the set of possible solutions, but more importantly these are simple yes-or-no assumptions, where the physicist can usually use his insight about the problem to say if the assumption is realistic or not. For example, any physically meaningful solution should be positive. The positivity constraint alone will not restrict the solution space very much, but in high energy physics applications we luckily usually know that the solution should also be monotonic and convex. This is especially true for the case of steeply falling differential cross sections, which are very commonly encountered in unfolding analyses. Fig. 2 demonstrates the improvement one can obtain by imposing shape constraints on the unfolded solution. Fig. 2: The ill-posedness of the unfolding problem yields estimates that are not physically plausible (green curve), but the situation can be improved by imposing physically justified shape constraints (blue curve). The true solution (black curve) is almost entirely hidden under the shape-constrained estimate. The beauty of shape-constrained unfolding is that we can use this approach to compute reliable uncertainties in the unfolded space. This is done by looking at the set of all those solutions that are, up to statistical uncertainties, consistent with the smeared observations while also satisfying the shape constraints. All solutions in this set are possible explanations for the observed data and hence this set provides a rigorous estimate of the uncertainty in the unfolded space. In technical terminology, the confidence intervals derived from this set have guaranteed frequentist coverage, provided that the true solution satisfies the shape constraints. The key here is to ask the solutions to both explain the data and satisfy the shape assumptions \u2013 without the latter, the uncertainty estimates would blow up and we would be back to square one. We demonstrated this approach using a simulation study designed to mimic the unfolding of the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum in the CMS experiment. The resulting unfolded uncertainties are shown in Fig. 3 for different shape constraints. Fig. 3: Shape-constrained uncertainties in the unfolding of the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum.  In this particular case, the true solution is known to be both positive, decreasing and convex and imposing all these constraints helps to significantly reduce our uncertainty about the unfolded spectrum. The envelopes shown in this figure have a very precise scientific meaning. Namely, if the experiment was repeated many times, they are guaranteed to contain the true solution at least 95% of the time. In other words, in the long run, at least 95% of our unfolded results would be correct in the sense that the envelope contains the truth. And this is precisely the key advantage of our new method: it guarantees by construction that the unfolded uncertainties have this important property, while none of the existing techniques based on smoothness assumptions can provide the same guarantee. Further information about this work is available in our arXiv preprint. (Written by M. Kuusela) Given the advanced nature of the topic, all readers are highly invited to ask for any kind of clarification and explanation in the comments\u2019 section. Juan will be happy to answer all your questions! The measurement of double Higgs production will be one of the central physics goals of the LHC program in its recently started high-energy phase, as well as for its future high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). Higgs pair production is directly sensitive to the Higgs trilinear coupling and provides crucial information on the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. It also probes the underlying strength of the Higgs interactions at high energies, and can be used to test the composite nature of the Higgs boson. Analogously to single Higgs production, in the Standard Model (SM) the dominant mechanism for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons at the LHC is gluon fusion, see Fig. 1 for representative leading-order Feynmann diagrams. For a center-of-mass energy of \u221as = 14 TeV, the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section is approximately 40 fb, so therefore around 12000 events with Higgs pairs are expected per LHC experiment at the end of Run II, and a factor 10 more at the end of the HL-LHC. Fig. 1: Representative Feynman diagrams for Higgs pair production in gluon fusion at leading order. Only the fermion triangle loop diagram (right) is directly sensitive to the Higgs trilinear coupling. In the SM, the fermion loops are dominated by the contribution from the top quark. Feasibility studies in the case of a SM Higgs boson in the gluon-fusion channel at the LHC have been performed for different final states, including bb\u03b3\u03b3, bb\u03c4+\u03c4\u2013, bbW+W\u2013, and bbbb. The main advantage of the bbbb final state is the enhancement of the signal yield from the large branching fraction of Higgs bosons into bb-pairs, BR(H\u2192bb)\u22450.57. On the other hand, a measurement in this channel needs to deal with an overwhelming QCD multi-jet background. Previous studies of this final state estimate that, even at the HL-LHC, it will be very difficult to observe Higgs pair production. Very recently, within a collaboration of theorists and experimentalists from Oxford, we have revisited the feasibility of SM Higgs pair production by gluon-fusion in the bbbb final state at the LHC in a new study. The authors include members of the Oxford node of the AMVA4NP network, Daniela Bortoletto, Cigdem Isserver and myself, as well as three postdocs, Katharina Behr (who just moved to DESY), James Frost, and Nathan Hartland. In our analysis, the selection is divided into three different categories, depending on the event topology: the resolved (with four well separated b-jets), boosted (with two fat jets containing each the decay products of a Higgs boson) and intermediate category. These three categories are optimized separately and then combined. There are several improvements compared to previous works, including a detailed simulation of the background contamination from light jets mis-identified as bottom-quark jets, and the assessment of how the high pileup (number of collisions per bunch crossing) conditions expected at the HL-LHC degrade the results. From the methodological point of view, the main difference is that our analysis is based upon a combination of traditional cut-based methods and multivariate analysis (MVA), in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Multivariate techniques are by now a mature tool in high-energy physics data analysis, opening new avenues to improve the performance of many measurements and searches at high energy colliders. In particular, the classification of events into signal and background processes by means of MVAs is commonly used in LHC applications. The specific type of MVA that we used in our work is a multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), known as a perceptron, and also sometimes as deep neural network. In Fig. 2 you see an illustrative example of one of the ANNs used, with a total of Nvar = 21 input variables. This type of ANN is the same as the ones used to parametrize the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton in the NNPDF global analyses, of which myself and Nathan are also members. Fig. 2: Schematic of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used for the analysis of the boosted category, with Nvar=21 input variables and thus the same number of neurons in the first layer. The color code in the neuron connections (the weights) is a heat map obtained at the end of the Genetic Algorithms training, with red indicating larger values and black indicating smaller values. The MVA inputs are a set of kinematic variables describing the signal and background events that satisfy the requirements of the cut-based analysis. The output of the trained ANNs also allows for the identification, in a fully automated way, of the most relevant variables in the discrimination between signal and background. The training of the neural networks consists in the minimization of a suitable figure of merit, in this case the so-called cross-entropy error function, to maximize the discrimination between signal and background events. This training is performed using Genetic Algorithms (GA), non-deterministic minimization strategies suitable for the solution of complex optimization problems, for instance when a very large number of quasi-equivalent minima are present. GAs are inspired by natural selection processes that emulate biological evolution. To avoid the possibility of over-fitting, we used a cross-validation stopping criterion. This cross-validation proceeds by dividing the input Monte Carlo (MC) dataset into two disjoint sets, and to use one of them to train the ANN and the other one for validation: the optimal stopping point is then given by the minimum of the error function to the validation sub-sample. This indicates the point where the ANN begins to train upon statistical fluctuations in the input MC samples, rather than learning the underlying (smooth) physical distributions. In Fig. 3 we show the distribution of the ANN output at the end of the GA minimization, in the case of the boosted selection. The separation between signal and background is achieved by introducing a cut, ycut, on the ANN output, so that MC events with yi \u2265 ycut are classified as signal events, and those with yi < ycut as background events. Therefore, the more differentiated the distribution of the ANN output is for signal and background events, the more efficient the MVA discrimination will be. Fig. 3: The distributions, at the end of the GA training, for the signal and background MC events in the boosted category, as a function of the ANN output. As we see, the algorithm achieves a very good separation between the two types of events. The main results of our study for the case of the HL-LHC are collected in Table 1, where we show the signal significance, S/\u221aB, and signal-over-background ratio, S/B, before the MVA is applied (ycut = 0) and after the optimal MVA cut is applied in each category. Table 1: The signal significance, S/\u221aB, and signal-over-background ratio, S/B, at the HL-LHC, before the MVA is applied (ycut=0), and after the optimal MVA cut is applied in each category. The most remarkable result is the substantial improvement in signal significance when going from the purely traditional cut-based analysis to the final results including also MVA: for example, in the resolved category the significance increases from 0.4 to 2.0. Also very important, the signal over background ratio is increased by two orders of magnitude. To summarize, multivariate techniques have the potential to improve the signal significance for processes with complicated final states, such as hh\u21924b, as compared to traditional cut-based analyses. Our study not only illustrates how the 4b final state should be enough to observe Higgs pair production at the HL-LHC, but, even more remarkably, demonstrates that, provided the signal selection efficiency and background rejection can be improved, there might be even some hope for Run II. However, ours is only a phenomenological feasibility study: the real challenge, the actual measurement of the hh\u21924b process by ATLAS and CMS, will take several years. But at least we have shown that we have many reasons to be optimistic! (Written by J. Rojo) Sorry if the title of this post is a bit deceiving \u2013 this post is addressed specifically to Italian students in HEP, at the level of \u201cLaurea Magistrale\u201d or first year PhD students. So, the INFN has an opening for 16 internship positions at CERN, TRIUMF, Fermilab, and KEK. The students will spend their time on a project chosen among 25 different work plans. They will be followed full-time by an advisor at the laboratory. The gross salary is of 8064 euro. The details of the positions can be obtained at this site. The deadline is June 29th. More details and the application form are available on the Italian site of Commissione 1. One of the proposed work plans involves a research we are carrying out at INFN-Padova: the search for anomalous production of Higgs boson pairs with the CMS detector. We have discussed the analysis in more detail in previous articles here \u2013 he who searches will find. The scientific program is described as follows: \u201cSearch for Anomalous Double Higgs Production with CMS\u201d: The program foresees the analysis of Run 2 data collected by the CMS experiment in the search for pair production of Higgs bosons, a rare process in the SM (\u03c3(SM, 13 TeV)=38 fb) which could however be strongly enhanced by anomalous values of five couplings whose value is at the time of writing not well constrained by direct measurement. The group searches for the HH\u2192bbbb final state in multijet data. Due to its large branching fraction this is the most sensitive search channel. The group foresees to produce a limit to SM production in August; thereafter, with the help of the student, we will recast the search (by a full re-optimization of the analysis procedure) to exclude regions of the parameter space of the anomalous couplings, by considering 12 benchmarks as defined in a recent publication (A.Carvalho et al., \u201cHiggs pair production: choosing benchmarks with cluster analysis\u201d, J.Inst. 2016 (4) 1-28). The recasting will involve a tuning of the BDT classifier to account for the kinematical properties of the considered benchmarks and a study of how the extracted limits propagate to the full 5-dimensional space of model parameters.\u201d The skills required and to be acquired by the candidate are the following: The trainee will be closely followed in daily research activities by the mentor (M. Tosi). He/she will identify, for each benchmark model, the most promising kinematical variables to discriminate the signal; then train a BDT classifier and optimize it; re-run the fit to extract limits; and finally extrapolate results to the full model space. In this activity the trainee will cooperate tightly with the other group members. During the first two weeks he/she will be trained to train and test the classifier. In the following two months the trainee will optimize the classification for the 12 benchmarks. The last period of internship will be spent to extract limits on model parameters. The initial competences required are familiarity with C++ and root (python welcome). After the training the student will be at ease with multivariate analysis applications to high-energy physics problems. But hurry up! The applications deadline is June 29th! Feature image credit: http://www.milfordfestival.org.uk/ This summer the AMVA4NewPhysics network entersÂ a phase of intense activities, on multiple fronts. On one side there are events of interest of the network: We already reported here about the SOS school of statistics organized by IN2P3, Lyon and Grenoble. The school, which took place at l\u2019Escandille, in Autrans, between May 30th and June 3rd, saw the participation as speakers of two network members, Julian Donini and Tommaso Dorigo; and the participation as attendees of several other network members, including Giles, Anna, and Emmanuel. The following week, CERN featured the school on MatLab and Statistical Learning by Ilya Narsky, a member of the network partner MathWorks. That event was attended by Anna, Alessia, Cecilia, Andrea, and Tommaso, and saw the participation of over 100 students. Last week, Pablo attended the second Yandex school of Machine Learning in Lund. I am confident he will soon have something very interesting to report here about that event! Then I should mention the Erice school of Science Journalism, which is being attended by Sabine this week; this year the theme is \u201cFundamental Science\u201d. I believe Sabine will soon post something to summarize the event here. In July, members of the network will meet in Kolymbari, near Chania on the island of Crete, for the 5th International Conference of New Frontiers in Physics (ICNFP). There, a special session on Higgs pair production and beyond-Standard-Model Higgs sectors will take place. The event will be attended by Pablo and Tommaso. And last but not least, from August 28th to September 3rd there will be the XIIth edition of the \u201cQuark Matter and the Hadron Spectrum\u201d conference in Thessaloniki, where a special session on \u201cStatistical methods for physics analysis in the XXI century\u201d has been organized by Tommaso Dorigo. The event, sponsored by the network, will see the active participation of several network members: speakers at the session include Bruno Scarpa, Pietro Vischia, and Pablo de Castro Manzano; and the convener of the session is the scientific coordinator of the AMVA4NewPhysics network, Tommaso Dorigo. As you can see, there is no dearth of training events in our network! But there is more. In fact, secondments of our Ph.D. students start this summer, with a gathering of three of them (Giles, Cecilia, and Alessia) in Oxford in July, and another month together in Padova of Pablo, Greg, Giles, and Cecilia in September. In these occasions the students will team up to tackle common problems in data analysis \u2013 in particular, the study of Higgs boson pair production, and methods to search for that process in LHC data. As you know, the network includes both ATLAS and CMS collaborators, so the joining of efforts may seem problematic; nevertheless, we have designed a program which will allow the students to work together on the problems and then implement the solutions separately on the private data of the two collaborations. What is left to say here is only that I hope the attendees of the many events we scheduled this summer will soon let us know their impressions and what they found most interesting there\u2026 (Image credit: Jillbooks.wordpress.com) Founded in 2007 by Russia\u2019s leading web search provider and one of its largest IT companies, the Yandex School of Data Analysis (YSDA) has been offering the knowledge, experience, skills and insights of its teachers, students and graduates to the global high-energy physics community since 2011. With its free Master\u2019s-level program in computer science and data analysis, the Yandex School of Data Analysis brings together accomplished scientists, researchers, and engineers, who share their knowledge and experience with graduates in software engineering, mathematics, information retrieval and related fields. Designed by Yandex to create and nurture a pool of talent primarily for the company\u2019s own needs, the School now welcomes students and interns from all over the world who take this opportunity to hone and develop their skills, pursue their interests and apply their ideas in the real-life environment provided by a major technology company. Located at Yandex\u2019s headquarters in the heart of Moscow, in addition to offering hands-on experience in developing breakthrough technologies and end-user products, the School gives its students and interns an opportunity to join lectures and seminars by legendary scientists (Albert Shiryaev reads courses on stochastics and probability models), as well as new-generation contributors to data science (Konstantin Vorontsov with his methods in machine learning and Victor Lempitsky sharing all he knows about deep learning). The School\u2019s joint programs with Russia\u2019s leading universities, including the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, the Lomonosov Moscow State University, and the Higher School of Economics, create a unique multidisciplinary platform for sharing knowledge and generating ideas. The School\u2019s faculty members, active researchers and experienced engineers also contribute to a number of specialist contests and challenges, including the \u2018Flavours of Physics\u2019 contest co-organized with LHCb, University of Zurich and University of Warwick in 2015. The YSDA is also one of the organisers of LHCb\u2019s annual Summer School on Machine Learning in High Energy Physics, which took place last year in Saint Petersburg and will be hosted by Lund University in Sweden this year. Following a long-term collaboration of its founding company, Yandex, with LHCb through CERN\u2019s openlab partnership program, the YSDA joined LHCb as an associate member in 2014, and became its full member in 2015. The School\u2019s specialists provide continuous support to LHCb\u2019s EventIndex (which will soon be joined by the forthcoming EventFilter) and develop new tools and services specifically for the needs of CERN researchers. The YSDA\u2019s collaboration with LHCb has already resulted in an optimization of the speed of its topological trigger by using Yandex\u2019s machine learning algorithm, MatrixNet, which improved the signal efficiency in Run-II vs Run-I by up to 60%. Optimization of the experiment\u2019s grid data storage by the YSDA specialists resulted in saving up to 40% of disk space. The School\u2019s collaboration with LHCb also produced the Reproducible Experiment Platform(REP), a software infrastructure that allows research teams to run computational experiments on shared big datasets, including those in high-energy physics. Another product of the YSDA-LHCb collaboration is a service for managing Jupyter-based research environments, everware, which, among other things, allows performing studies, such as gravitational wave analysis, or CP-violation, or a J/psi mass analysis. The range of products developed by the Yandex School of Data Analysis for LHCb includes tools and services for monitoring data quality and predicting anomalies in the enormous amounts of data generated in the experiment. The YSDA continues seeking new innovative ways of applying data analysis and machine learning in high-energy physics, and welcomes research visitors to work on its projects in Moscow. by João Varela The Laboratório de Instrumentação e Física Experimental de Partículas, LIP, was created to exploit the unique opportunities created for fundamental research in Portugal by the country\u2019s accession to CERN in 1985. LIP brought experimental particle physics in Portugal to a truly international ground and shall continue to lead and develop this effort, ensuring the full participation of the national scientific community in the experimental discovery of the fundamental laws of the Universe. Current challenges include the detailed investigation of the origin of mass and the search for new laws of physics at the LHC, the re-creation of conditions that existed just after the Big Bang, or the discovery of dark matter particles. LIP has the mission to enhance the direct access of the national scientific community to international research facilities and collaborations in particle physics. We aim to inspire the younger generations to pursue careers in science and technology, through international collaboration, excellence in research and training, and opportunities for engaging with society. LIP is the reference institution for experimental particle physics and associated technologies in Portugal. We are present in Lisbon, Coimbra and Braga, in close collaboration with the local universities. The geographically distributed nature of LIP reflects the need to articulate strategies at national level, in an area of research often conducted within large international collaborations or using large scientific infrastructures. LIP is devoted to research and development in experimental particle physics, new instruments and methods, and advanced computing. Also central to our mission are advanced training, supporting education in science and technology and the promotion of the public engagement in this field of science. LIP further aims at strengthening the links between academia and industry, fostering technology transfer, and promoting the participation of Portuguese industry at CERN and other international scientific organizations. LIP\u2019s distributed computing infrastructures are used by many other research institutions. The participation in experiments at CERN remains central in the activities of LIP. We are deeply involved in the CERN LHC endeavour, contributing from the very beginning to the two largest LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS. With these fantastic scientific instruments we are studying Nature in many ways, from deepening our understanding of the Higgs boson, to searching for new physics or recreating the conditions that existed just after the Big Bang. LIP activities are developed also in collaboration with the European Space Agency and international scientific infrastructures such as the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, the Pierre Auger Observatory, SURF (LUX) and the GSI research centre in Darmstadt. The group involved in the AMVA4NewPhysics network develops its activity at LIP-Lisbon under the coordination of J. Varela. The group participates in the CMS collaboration since its creation in 1992. It had a leading role in the design and construction of the data acquisition system of the ECAL sub-detector used for the measurement of electrons and photons and contributed to the CMS trigger system that selects the interesting collisions for data storage. After the LHC start-up in 2010 the group made major contributions to the CMS physics program, in particular to the discovery of a Higgs boson; to the measurement of the top quark properties; to the measurement of the \u03c8 and \u03a5 polarizations; to the measurement of the rare dimuon decays of Bs mesons; and to the searches of a charged Higgs. After a two-year shutdown the LHC resumed operation in 2015 with the energy increased to 13 TeV. In preparation for the new beam conditions, the LIP group contributed to the upgrade of the experiment building and installing of a new plant of high-speed optical links that interface the ECAL electronics to the trigger system. The LIP group is currently leading the development of the new forward proton sub-detector (CT-PPS). Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in western Europe, with a history that stretches back to its original settlement by the Celts, and the eventual establishment of Phoenician and Greek trading posts (c. 800\u2013600 BC). Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia Olissipo. Ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century, it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century. In 1147, the Crusaders under Afonso Henriques (1st King of Portugal) reconquered the city and since then it has been a major political, economic and cultural centre of Portugal. In the 16th century Lisbon was one of the richest cities in the world. Supported by Lisbon\u2019s merchants, King John II actively pursued the Atlantic exploration, reviving the work of his uncle, Henry the Navigator, pushing ever further south on the west coast of Africa with the purpose of discovering a maritime route for spice trade with the East. In 1498 a fleet captained by the Vasco da Gama arrived in India. It followed a golden age for Lisbon, which controlled for several decades all trade from Ceuta to Japan. Today Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal. Its urban area has a population of around 2.7 million people.                                    By now the adrenaline from the announcement of the first direct detection of gravitational waves has subsided, and we can discuss the particulars of the observation. Here, I\u2019ll try to describe the state of the detectors, answer some questions about the analysis methods, and highlight a few points about the detection that might have gotten lost in the excitement. In 2010, following a series of observing runs, the LIGO instruments shut down for a complete upgrade. This upgrade has been a success, and during the summer of last year we began to prepare for a three-month observing run in the fall. Our observing runs begin with a \u201csoft start\u201d, a period of a few weeks reserved for calibration measurements and other prep work. In the strictest sense, when the event arrived we had not entered the official observing period, but the online calibration had been finalized, and the detector configuration was frozen. If the signal had arrived two weeks earlier, there might have been a chaotic rush to characterize the detectors and document their configuration. But by September 14 this was essentially complete. When an event is detected, the first question is how likely is it due to background noise in the detectors. Background estimation in gravitational wave searches is different than particle physics experiments. Gravitational wave detectors observe a high rate of loud, short-duration noise transients, much higher than would be expected from Gaussian noise alone. These are known in the industry as glitches, and are caused by a combination of environmental noise and instrument artefacts. We reject glitches by requiring exact coincidence between the detectors, as well as agreement with particular models for gravitational wave signals (for example, the famous chirp from the merger of compact objects). The background due to glitches cannot be modeled analytically, so we estimate it empirically using a time-slide technique. For each analysis, the data are re-analyzed, using the time-series from Hanford compared with the time-series from Livingston from, for example, five seconds later \u2013 much longer than the time it takes a gravitational wave to travel between the sites. The analysis is repeated for O(106) time steps to calculate how frequently the noise fluctuations in the detectors might align to generate an event, purely from chance. The event (denoted GW150914, following the nomenclature for gamma-ray bursts) was found with the highest significance in two independent searches for compact binary coalescences, or CBCs. These searches utilize matched filtering, where we calculate the overlap between the detector data and a set of template waveforms. The waveforms in the template bank are described by four parameters: the masses and overall spins of the compact objects. While each of the 250,000 templates amounts to a semi-independent test of the data against a particular model, this trials factor is naturally folded into our background estimation, where we have repeated the search, with the entire template bank, on several million independent realizations of the data. Thus, when we observe a signal with a given SNR, and we calculate from the time-slide analysis the number of events we are likely to observe with the same SNR that are due to noise, we are including events that arise from any template, not just the one that matched with the event. An event\u2019s significance is calculated using only the SNR, and the background rate for that SNR is marginalized over all of the templates. Our method for background estimation calculates the rate that random noise in the detectors will coincide, but it is blind to correlated noise. To reject correlated noise, we rely on the wide geographic separation of the detectors, and the sensitive array of environmental monitors at each site. A careful discussion of possible correlated noise is given in a companion paper on detector characterization. In short, we are confident that our environmental sensors will detect any plausible source of correlated noise (seismic noise, electromagnetic noise in the ionosphere, etc) at a threshold well below the level that would generate a signal in the output of the detectors. It\u2019s worth noting that the significance of GW150914 is not 5.1 \u03c3. It is much greater than 5.1 \u03c3! In the background estimation for our 16-day analysis period, we found no events from random coincidence as loud as GW150914. The value of 5.1 \u03c3 represents the limit on the background that we could estimate with the data available. It\u2019s also worth noting that this is only the second time that the detection of a new phenomena in physics has been claimed based on a single event. Similar to the detection of the Omega-minus, our discovery is convincing because we have a clear, tangible picture of the trace the event left in our detector. Now let\u2019s discuss the event. We have certainly been lucky, on two counts. First, we are lucky to have such a loud event for our first detection, one that rises unambiguously above the background and allows for exquisite parameter estimation. The loudness of the event cannot be over-emphasized: this knocked us over when we first saw it, and it may take one or two years before we detect another signal this loud. Second, we are lucky that the rate of binary black hole mergers is apparently quite high, on the high end of what had been estimated by astronomers. Prior to this event, one could reasonably predict that advanced LIGO would never see a BBH signal, since no plausible BBH systems had been observed in nature. The masses of the black holes are quite large, significantly larger than any of the stellar-mass black hole candidates that have been observed (in, for example, x-ray binaries). Black holes with masses more than thirty times the mass of our Sun are not easily made in nature. They form from large, low-metallicity stars that have weak stellar winds and retain most of their mass during their short lives before core-collapse and supernovae. Furthermore, how a system with two black holes this size can form is an open question: did it start as a binary system of two high-mass, low-metallicity stars, or was it formed via 3-body interactions between black holes in a globular cluster? These questions will be answered after we have detected an ensemble of events, and we can study their distributions in mass and redshift. With one event, gravitational waves have become the most precise test for general relativity. The match between the waveform and the prediction from GR is essentially perfect; details are given in a companion paper. Among other tests, the parameters of the black hole that remains following the merger can be estimated using different parts of the waveform: the part from the beginning of the signal to the peak of the amplitude, which describes the inspiral; and the part following the peak, which describes the merger and ring-down to an unperturbed Kerr geometry. These independent tests are in good agreement, demonstrating that the overall waveform is consistent with general relativity. In mid-January the LIGO detectors switched from an observing mode back to a period of commissioning. Gravitational wave detectors, like particle accelerators, don\u2019t achieve their design performance immediately. At the moment the LIGO instruments are about 3-4 times less sensitive than we can achieve with the current hardware. The instruments should reach their design sensitivity after another two to three years of commissioning, with regular breaks for increasingly more sensitive observations. And, later this year, the Virgo instrument outside of Pisa will finish its own advanced upgrade, followed by the KAGRA detector in Japan in 2018. At the design sensitivity, a signal like GW150914 will have an SNR of more than 50, and we will detect dozens of weaker events per year. For a field that has searched for decades and come up empty, it is only just sinking in that we will soon have an embarrassment of riches. We thank Daniel Hoak for this \u201cguest post\u201d on gravitational waves. Daniel earned his PhD in 2015 with the LIGO collaboration, and is currently working at the Virgo detector outside of Pisa. Today I gave a look at the geographical provenance of the visitors to this blog, to see what progress we have made in the course of its eight months of activity. Of course starting a new blog is never easy \u2013 attracting regular readers is difficult, and the offer of good outreach material nowadays is very broad; so you need to post regularly, and add good content. All in all I am satisfied of our action, but there\u2019s room for improvement; I should mention that the AMVA4NewPhysics network is still recruiting its PhD students, so the volume of posting has not reached its plateau yet. If we look at the world map that wordpress produces in its \u201cstats\u201d page, we see that this blog has by now reached out a little bit everywhere, except the middle east and Africa. I can imagine that the scarce opportunities of internet connection and the life conditions in many african countries make it tough to surf the web there, but I am a bit surprised by the middle east. Zero visits from Iran ?? Iran is a big country, with lots of scientists and a high education level. I understand that internet restrictions may play a role here, and I do not know the exact situation, but I was a bit surprised. Maybe some expatriates from there can comment on this\u2026 Anyway, this was meant to be just a short post based on that map, but as I am writing it I realize that some members of our network have asked for more information on the success of the blog in terms of traffic \u2013 the blog is one of the network deliverables, which means that the European Union judges us on its merits. So let me paste here a graph of the monthly visits since last December. As you can see, there is a generally positive trend, interrupted by one spike last May, due to a single post collecting a large number of visits by itself (it was Pablo de Castro\u2019s post on why physicists are not good software developers). My goal for the first year was to reach a steady 10,000 views per month, and I think we will not make it although in principle we would have the potential of doing it. We have four more months to go, though. If you want to help, link us!   As I write this, I have on my desk a pile of brochures that INFN and the University of Padova Department of Physics and Astronomy have produced in the context of the program \u201cEurope in my region\u201d. Thanks to the work, among others, of our press office coordinator Sabine Hemmer, these brochures are real nice booklets in the end. They will be distributed during the \u201cResearchers\u2019 Night\u201d next Friday, September 29, in the context of the large number of initiatives that will take place in Padova \u2013 and to which will contribute the members of our network Martino dall\u2019Osso and Pablo de Castro, who will man the INFN stand in the center of Padova. What do these brochures contain? They describe the dozens of European Projects and Research in Physics and Astronomy that is partly funded by EU initiatives. Each main project takes one page \u2013 so AMVA4NewPhysics has its own -, plus other projects where INFN or the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy is a benficiary partner with a local responsible are also listed. So my name, if I am not mistaken, is the only one that appears twice \u2013 as coordinator of AMVA4NewPhysics and as local responsible of INSIGHTS. That is like a virtual pat on my back, of which I am very proud. The pdf of the brochure can be downloaded at this link. The text is in Italian, so I will just translate the one for AMVA4NewPhysics below. After some biographical notes on yours truly which I will spare you, the bookled reads: The research network sees the collaboration of over 50 participants from Universities, Research institutes and industrial partners from 10 different countries, among which the INFN of Padova and the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova. The large majority of the network researchers is involved in the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN in Geneva, experiments which in 2012 saw for the first time a signal of the Higgs boson. AMVA4NewPhysics has the scope of developing advanced statistical tools for data analysis both in the area of particle physics and for industrial applications, thus contributing to the development of advanced strategies for the search of new physics. At the heart of the project is the training of 10 young researchers who will obtain the Ph. D. title. Besides the acquiring of the needed know-how related to scientific research, the students will also have a chance to know the world of industry, through stages at the industrial partners of the network. The page is complemented with three pictures and the network logo. A snapshot is shown below. As for INSIGHTS, half a page is devoted to that project too. I will have more occasions to talk about that project, which is similar to AMVA4NewPhysics in many aspects.     Unlike previously understood, the last artwork by Venice high-school students featured in this blog, of a total of 39, is titled \u201cLe prospettive della luce\u201d (light\u2019s perspectives). It is a video produced by Alberto Bentsik, Tommaso Moretti, and Samuele Tonello , students of the Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d. The students filmed themselves as they worked on a wooden board, and produced a high-speed video that shows their actions like in a movie from the nineteen-twenties. This allowed them to \u201cdocument\u201d their creative process, which is a bit mysterious as we only get to see them planting nails on the board and doing other slightly obscure operations on it. The board is shown below. In the final frames of the video is shown the real result of their work \u2013 streaks of colour produced by red led lights shining on the board: that is their interpretation of the event displays of LHC proton-proton collisions. I must admit I was a bit puzzled by these images until I watched a bit more carefully the preparation phase in the first part of the video. But then I realized how the final images, on which the video unfortunately does not linger for long enough, do contain artistic value. Perhaps the criticism we can move to the students is that they should have highlighted a bit more the final result in their video. In any case, I like their effort and I hope you will too. Elisa Brocca and Emma Troni, two students from Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d, are the authors of the video titled \u201cBoson Motion\u201d. The students captured the video as a succession of frames that try to picture the collision of two LHC protons with coloured balls, and to explain the motion of massive and massless particles in the presence of the Higgs boson field. The result is a fun animation. The Art & Science contest is coming to a close, as tomorrow evening at 9PM, in the \u201cSala Perla\u201d of the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of the Lido of Venice, the best three selected works will be given prizes by the CERN director general Fabiola Gianotti, before the start of a conference centered on the mysteries of the universe. If you have a chance, please drop by \u2013 the entrance is free of charge! Five of the 39 works produced by the high school students of Venice for the Art & Science contest are video recordings. In general, the footage recording skills of the students have been shown to be quite good. In the video presented here this is especially true: the product is quite well assembled, the perspectives and colours are chosen with care, and the result pleasing. The students who produced the video are Filippo Baldan, Lorenzo Bottoni and Elia Mariotto, from the Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d in Venice. I must say that the creative process that led to this video, which allegedly started from the lectures on particle physics and the LHC search for the Higgs boson, remains obscure to me. The fact that the work is untitled also does not help. However, this artwork received significant appreciation here at the EPS conference, where it is shown on a large display in front of the area devoted to Venice students artworks.   This week I am in Pisa, where I have spent three days to discuss the status and the funding of accelerator-based experiments within the \u201cfirst national scientific committee\u201d of INFN. Yesterday all coordinators also met for dinner in a good fish restaurant. The discussion never departed much from physics, but it was certainly more relaxed and casual. One thing that I heard reported by a colleague who has the pulse of public engagement in INFN was that the last \u201cN\u201d in my institute\u2019s acronym causes sometimes a preconceived negative attitude in laypersons who hear about it \u2013 \u201cnuclear\u201d physics seems to evoke nuclear plants and in some European countries there is a distinct adversion to the concept. Nuclear plants are conceived as polluting ticking bombs, and those who work for and in them are enemies of the environment. I found the notion interesting and an important one to pay attention to. Public engagement also has the aim to explain the positive aspects of research and create a positive attitude in the civil society, so negative vibes need to be avoided. INFN was funded almost seventy years ago to pursue research in fundamental physics, at a time where the frontier was still around the atomic nucleus and not deep within it. Quarks would be hypothesized only over a decade later, for instance. So the \u201cN\u201d in the acronym (INFN as Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare) was fully justified despite the fact that the founders were really aiming at understanding Nature at its most intimate levels. In hindsight, INFN could well have been called \u201cINFF\u201d where one could have a second F for \u201cfundamental\u201d. Yet \u201cnuclear\u201d did not have back then the ominous connotation it has now \u2013 even the bad vibes from the recent Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were rather associated with the word \u201catomic\u201d rather than \u201cnuclear\u201d. Nor was there any idea that the public perception of basic research, social media amplifications and distortions, and communication issues would become so important seventy years later. And of course INFN indeed also does research in nuclear physics, no less fundamental than that which has more distinctly characterized its activities even in the recent past \u2013 large HEP experiments at the major physics labs, such as ATLAS and CMS today. Nuclear matter at the highest temperatures and pressures is studied both at the LHC (with the ALICE experiment) and in other laboratories around the world, and INFN is deeply involved in these endeavours. Since we cannot change the name of the institute (or can we?), maybe at least we can try and be more proactive in explaining that the real mission of INFN is the deepening of our understanding of fundamental physics and the investigation of applications of the resulting knowledge and technology. We do not build nuclear plants. Finally I should mention that the word \u201cPhysics\u201d comes from Greek \u201c\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\u201d which means \u201cnature\u201d -ultimately coming itself from an ancient word (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c9) meaning \u201cgrowth\u201d. There is nothing innatural in investigating fundamental physics \u2013 we study Nature! Maybe this concept should be more publicized through the social-media-dominated communication avenues with the general public. Don\u2019t be hostile to fundamental research in physics: many good things have come from an increased understanding of nuclear and subnuclear physics, and more are yet to come.   The EPS conference starts this afternoon in the Palazzo del Casinò of the Lido of Venice. For three days the big palace facing the Adriatic sea will host the parallel sessions of the conference; next Monday the plenary sessions will instead take place in the adjoining Palazzo del Cinema. During the whole week of the conference, at the Palazzo del Casinò an exposition of over 50 artworks inspired by particle physics and the Higgs boson will be waiting for you to visit. Besides works by affirmed artists, the exposition sports two dozen works by high-school students, who were inspired by lectures in particle physics during the spring and then challenged to produce something artistic to express their impressions. Below are pictures of the exposition I just grabbed with my cellphone. I hope you will be able to stop by if you live in the area! Please remember that on Saturday, July 8th, at 9PM a public conference will take place in Sala Perla, at the Palazzo del Casinò. At the start of the event the students who won the contest will receive prizes offered by the AMVA4NewPhysics network.                                              The work \u201cImpronta di una collisione\u201d (footprint of a collision) is authored by Emma Da Re and Alessia Scarpa, two high-school students from the Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d of Venice. They tried to picture the concept that when we study the collisions that give rise new particles such as the Higgs boson, we cannot observe the real target of our investigation, but rather the effect that its production has on the surrounding space. Similarly, the breaking of glass can be observed \u201cafter the fact\u201d \u2013 what remains is a footprint that betrays the physics process that took place before. The students used two layers of glass which they fractured and then infiltrated with colours. The result is, in my opinion, really beautiful, and the idea behind it makes it even more interesting. This work was selected for the art exhibit that is about to be opened to the public at the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of the Lido of Venice, in conjunction with the start of the EPS 2017 conference. Leonardo Cosma, Francesco Turcato and Nicola Vianello, from Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d in Venice are the authors of a untitled work that they composed using a Newton pendulum, glass, and a mirror in a metal frame. The idea of particles moving and breaking glass appears in this work as in the one presented in the previous post. Here, however, the idea is to show the dynamics of the interaction between colliding bodies, which can be achieved by moving the balls from their equilibrium positions. The pictures below cannot capture the dynamics but it should not be too hard to imagine it. Do you remember the infamous \u201cg-2\u201d measurement ? The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been for over a decade in the agenda of HEP physicists, both as a puzzle and as a hope for good things to come. Ever since the Brookhaven laboratories estimated the quantity at a value over 3 standard deviations away from the equally precise theoretical predictions, the topic (could the discrepancy be due to new physics??) has been commonplace in dinner table conversations among HEP physicists. Similarly, no self-respected \u201cglobal fit\u201d of standard model observable quantities or scan of allowed parameter space of supersymmetric theories has omitted to consider the constraining input coming from the tension between experiment and theory on the muon anomalous magnetic moment. What is causing the over 3-sigma discrepancy? This question is important because of the possible answer: new physics such as light supersymmetric particles or other things potentially at reach of experimental discovery at colliders could easily affect the value of g-2 and provide an explanation for the effect. Of course, the difference could also be due to mundane effects, such as a unknown systematic uncertainty in the experimental determination, or a mistake in the mind-bogglingly difficult theoretical calculation. Who writes here believes that indeed, either the latter or the former, or both, are the cause. But like it or not, the observed discrepancy is the most notable and long-standing effect that could herald the coming of new physics. But what is g-2 ? g, or rather, g_mu, is a constant that describes the magnetic moment of the muon. Elementary particles of unit charge endowed of spin were postulated to have an associated magnetic moment as early as in 1925, by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit. They proposed the following formula:  \u03bc = g e/2mc \u03c3 with g=2. Above, \u03bc is the magnetic moment of the particle, e is the charge in electron charge units, m is the particle mass, c is the speed of light, and \u03c3 is the vector describing the particle spin, which for elementary fermions takes the value of h/4\u03c0 , where h is Planck\u2019s constant. The electron magnetic moment had to wait until 1948  for its first determination (by Kusch and Foley): those guys found that for the electron, g had to be 1.00119+-0.00005 times larger than 2. The first triumph of the newborn quantum electrodynamics (QED) was in fact the theoretical determination of that factor, by Schwinger. By calculating all quantum loop effects influencing the \u201celectron-photon vertex\u201d -the point where an electron emits or absorbs a photon- he found that the factor had to be equal to 1.00116, in great agreement to the measurement. There is thus an \u201canomalous\u201d contribution to the magnetic moment, due to quantum effects. Quantum loops are virtual processes that affect a particle\u2019s propagation in vacuum. An electron, for example, may emit and immediately reabsorb a photon as it moves in spacetime. The emitted photon, before it is reabsorbed, may in turn transmute for an unmeasurably small instant, into a virtual electron-positron pair. And so on. These processes constitute modifications to the behaviour and the properties of the original particle (such as, in fact, its magnetic moment), so unless they are properly computed one cannot really predict the phenomenology of the particle. Nowadays, the anomalous electron magnetic moment is measured with an astounding precision, at 1.001 159 652 180 730, give or take 280 quadrillionths. The theoretical estimate is also astoundingly precise, and it beautifully matches the experimental precision: the current value is 1.001 159 652 181 643, give or take 764 quadrillionths. If this does not convince you that quantum electrodynamics works, nothing ever will! Quantum corrections that cause the discrepancy from g=2 arise from the same fundamental processes for all kinds of elementary charged leptons, so (accounting for the different mass of the leptons) the kind of physics insight one gathers from these comparisons of theory and experiments is the same. Nowadays the attention of HEP physicists has focused on measuring the muon magnetic moment more than the electron one, because there is more room for improvement with muons, and because of the preconception that new physics particles would more likely produce a larger effect on the physics of heavier leptons. The muon anomalous magnetic moment is theoretically estimated at 0.001 165 918 040 +- 510. The present experimental determination comes, as already stated, from Brookhaven (see their muon ring in the picture above), where muons were put in a circular orbit and the precession of their spin was carefully measured in a landmark experiment. The result is 1.001 165 920 890 +- 540+-330, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second due to systematic sources. As you can see, there is a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations between this number and the theoretical estimate previously quoted. Brookhaven has closed its muon g-2 experiment, but a new one at Fermilab is starting this fall, and it is expected to reach a precision of 0.14 parts per million on the deviation from 1.0: that is three and a half times better accuracy than the Brookhaven determination. That\u2019s is great news, but if the theoretical estimate does not correspondingly improves, the Fermilab effort will largely be wasted \u2013 the result could still show a discrepancy from theory, but not one formally discovering new physics in the lepton-photon vertex! Theorists at work Like the ones of other leptons, the anomalous muon magnetic moment results from the sum of three different contributions: one coming from purely QED effects (loops where the virtual particles are electrons, positrons, and photons); one coming from the intervention of electroweak bosons (W and Z), and one coming from virtual loop corrections involving hadrons. Yes, hadrons: a photon can turn into a virtual quark-antiquark pair, and the quarks, before they disappear back into the original photon, can do whatever they please -they\u2019re virtual! For instance, they may create a hadron resonance. The graph on the right shows just the simplest Feynman diagrams that \u201cmodify\u201d the lepton-photon vertex with QED loops. As you can see, there\u2019s heaps of different virtual processes that need to be considered. Ah, there\u2019s the rub. The QED and EW contributions are quite hard to contribute, but the real headache for theorists comes from \u201cQCD\u201d ones \u2013 ones involving hadrons, that is. The reason is that one needs to consider all possible ways that virtual quarks have to interact, and these can indeed produce virtual hadrons, that are complex, messy objects. The operation theorists have to do, in order to estimate the virtual hadrons contribution to the muon magnetic moment, is to sum over a multitude of possible reactions, weighted by their respective probabilities and importance. That is, a complex integral. The diagram to evaluate is shown below (left), where the red blob is the stuff they need to compute. Time flows from left to right, and if you concentrate on the top portion of the graph, computing it means \u201ccutting the blob in half\u201d, thereby assessing the rate of \u201clepton pair goes to hadrons through a photon exchange\u201d. How messy the integration of that reaction is can be appreciated by looking at the graph on the right above, which describes, as a function of the energy of the process, the rate at which a lepton pair can materialize hadrons. As you can see, at specific energies there are many resonances, particles that the quark-antiquark pairs can produce for short instants. The trick, and a new proposed experiment But wait a minute. Aren\u2019t time and space totally interchangeable in the quantum world? Yes sir, they are. So the complicated diagram above can be turned by 90 degrees, and what becomes of a reaction turning leptons into hadrons is a simple scattering process (see below, left), whereby you have leptons on one side, leptons on the other, and the mess occurs in a \u201cspace-like\u201d exchange \u2013 one which does not give rise to resonances! (Note that time again flows left to right). The hadronic mess has disappeared by changing space with time, and the integration now does not need to be performed over those complicated hadronic structures, but rather on a dimensionless variable x over which the integrand is smooth (see right function above). However, that integrand must be determined with the help of experimental input, Then, once computed, the result can be easily reconverted to the one for the unrotated diagram. What needs to be done is to determine from experiment the red curve above, by performing a lepton-lepton scattering experiment. The important region to determine, in the kinematics phase space, is the one where the integrand is large \u2013 around the peak of the curve above. This can be accomplished with electron-positron scattering (what is called in HEP \u201cBhabha scattering\u201d) but unfortunately there are no present-day detectors in operation and suitable beams that can provide that measurement (the closest one is KLOE, a 1-GeV experiment measuring kaons, but the angle of scattering of largest relevance for the measurement is one where KLOE is blind). So what a group of theorists and experimentalists is proposing to do is to take a muon beam -and there is a suitable one at CERN- and direct it to a light target, where muons can scatter off electrons. The measurement of the differential cross section of that scattering process will provide points in the red curve above, and ultimately, a much more precise determination of the QCD contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment! A schematic of the proposed experimental setup is shown below. In the first schematic above are shown four \u201cstations\u201d impinged by a muon beam coming from the left. The grey targets are of light material -eg. beryllium- to minimize multiple scattering, which is a real enemy here, as you want to determine the exiting angles of the two particles with the utmost precision. Planes of silicon microstrip or pixel sensors (the vertical black bars) should provide accurate measurement of the trajectories of muon and electron, and an electromagnetic calorimeter should identify the electron and in particular determine if its energy is larger than 1 MeV, as this datum is quite important to determine the kinematics (but of course, the full energy measurement helps constraining the kinematics). A muon detector placed downstream would complement the setup. The strategy to reduce the uncertainty in the hadronic contribution to the anomalous muon magnetic moment is detailed in a paper submitted to the arxiv: 1609.08987. The group of Italians (both theorists and experimentalists) plans to perform a first test beams to design the experiment, and then to start producing the targets and the muon and electron detectors that are needed to precisely determine the kinematics of the muon-electron scatterings. This should be fun, and I sincerely hope they will succeed in bringing down the uncertainty in the theoretical determination. For g-2 is still the one anomaly (now intended as discrepancy from the standard model) which is the most credible first crack in a theory that has held on for over forty years now, and that we all hope will soon leave room for a whole new world of new physics! I should not forget to acknowledge Massimo Passera here, for he gave a seminar to propose this experiment in Padova a few days ago, and much of what I wrote above comes from material I took there. Massimo is among the authors of the above cited article, and an active member of the group. (This article has first appeared on www.science20.com) The work strangely titled \u201cNGM\u201d (it\u2019s an acronym for the names of its three authors) is quite strange-looking, both for the choice of materials and for its visual appearance. The three high-school students who produced it (Nicol\u0102\u02db Patrizio, Giovanni Felisi, Matteo Carraro), from the Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d of Â Venice, explained that the choice of materials was at the very heart of their creative process. Wood and copper were used to assemble a structure that remains a bit mysterious in its meaning. This is not uncommon in contemporary artworks, so we have to accept the insecurity. The pictures below show the assembly from two sides.     The work titled \u201cLimite mentale\u201d (mental limit) is the result of the artistic effort of Luca Seccarello and Nanni Visintin, students from the Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d of Venice who along with 70 more participated in the \u201cArt & Science\u201d contest organized by the AMVA4NewPhysics network in Venice as part of a bigger initiative of the \u201cCREATIONS\u201d EU network. Two days now are left before the prize-giving event in \u201cSala Perla\u201d at the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of the Lido of Venice, where since yesterday the EPS 2017 conference is taking place. On the evening of July 8th, at 9PM, Fabiola Gianotti (the CERN Director General) will deliver prizes to the authors of the best artworks among 39 produced by the Venice high school students. \u201cLimite Mentale\u201d is an assembly of four small square paintings. The students thus explained the concept behind their creation: Like the triangle which does not exist in reality, but takes life in our mind when we look at the assembly, a particle created in a LHC collision may only exist thanks to the tracks of its decay products. The assembly is visible in the fisrt of the two pictures below. The second shows the central square painting alone.   On Saturday, July 8th, the \u201cSala Perla\u201d of the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db was crowded by 600 attendees, who filled all seats and then some. The event, titled \u201cUniverso: tempo zero \u2013 breve storia dell\u2019inizio\u201d, was organized in conjunction with the international EPS conference, which takes place until this Wednesday at Lido of Venice, and was sponsored by the AMVA4NewPhysics network. It featured a discussion between the anchor, Silvia Rosa Brusin, and a few guests: Fabiola Gianotti, general director of CERN; Antonio Masiero, vice-president of INFN; and Mirko Pojer, responsible of operations of the LHC collider. The program was enriched by a few videos, and by readings by Sonia Bergamasco and jazz music by Umberto Petrin. At the start of the evening, the Venice high-school students who won the \u201cArt&Science\u201d contest were given prizes (consumer electronics and gadgetry) offered by AMVA4NewPhysics as well as plaques with certificates. The winners, Martina Ciampi and Elena Murer, received in addition to the gadgets and the plaque a grant for visiting CERN. In addition, a total of 11 artworks were selected to participate in the final exposition, which will take place next spring in Naples. There, they will compete with other works produced in four other Italian cities, for more grants to visit CERN. The formula of offering entertainment mixed to physics explanations has been seen to work well in past occasions, and this time was no exception at all. The guests were allowed to talk about abstruse things such as \u201cthe Higgs field\u201d and \u201cdark energy\u201d, but they did not have enough time to tisk making things less than entertaining. In fact, the rythm of the evening remained well paced and the time flew almost too quickly. Of this credit has to be given to the conductor, Silvia Rosa Brusin; the actress Sonia Bergamasco gave a very beautiful touch of literature to the mix, by reading two touching pieces. The success of the evening is a proof that Italy is a place where these initiatives can be very successful \u2013 it is not too hard to fill a theatre if some care is put in organizing an event with multiple attractives. And, of course, free of charge. So the budget is the issue: when there is money things work out. But as a member of the organizing committee, I can tell you that money is only one ingredient: a huge amount of work and dedication went in producing this result. Below are a few pictures I took of the evening. Above: the three guests chat with the conductor and Sonia Bergamasco during the Q/A session. The audience before the start Sonia Bergamasco reads. The work titled \u201cBo(om)son\u201d was created by Nicol\u0102\u02db Dall\u2019Asta, Matilde Giupponi, and Tommaso Gridella, al from Liceo \u201cG.B. Benedetti\u201d of Venice. They used a blackboard, nails, coloured elastics, and they surrounded the board with a tape with led lights (the latter cannot be seen in the image provided below, unfortunately). The geometric theme transpires from this compostion, which like many others takes inspiration from what the students perceived as an \u201cexplosion\u201d. The thirtieth work presented here was created by high school students of Liceo \u201cG.B.Benedetti\u201d by Francesca Vavasori, Alexis Venturi, and Acebo Venice Maria Fe Sales. The composition is three-dimensional and consists in a structure supporting two balls tiled with small mosaics. The Â students took free inspiration from a particle collision and created a colourful sculpture, as can be seen in the pictures below. The artwork titled \u201cMAP\u201d presented here is surprising in a way. The students of Liceo Benedetti who produced it (Matteo Bertola, Alberto Perosa, Giacomo Indri) exhibited quite a bit of imagination in creating a \u201cparticle\u201d accelerator using kitchenware: a manual salad dryer. They inserted three coloured plastic balls in it, added some coloured wire to the exterior of the rotating cell, and that is it: the MAP. The pictures below do not pay justice to the concept, as what should be done is to turn the handle and set the balls in motion, then observe them from the outside as they spin and their colours merge in a whitish hue. Aiming at the broadening and transmission of human knowledge, university is one of the best inventions of the Middle Ages. The Université catholique de Louvain has played a part in this process with pride since 1425. Just to cite a few: Erasmus, Vésale, Mercator and many others came to Louvain to profit from its location at the heart of Europe. Closely combining teaching and research, the Université catholique de Louvain set up ten faculties, institutes, special schools, laboratories and seminaries and took over the running of clinics and hospitals. The goal of the university has remained unchanged: to spread learning throughout the world, to support a passion for knowledge and research and to train those who, generations upon generations, deal with the burning issues of their time. Georges Lemaître (1894-1966) is a perfect illustration of these principles. He was a Belgian priest, astronomer and professor of physics at the Université catholique de Louvain. He proposed the theory of the expansion of the universe and was the first to derive what is now known as Hubble\u2019s law. Lemaître also proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he called his \u201chypothesis of the primeval atom\u201d.  Lemaître was also an early adopter of computers for cosmological calculations. He introduced the first computer to the university (a Burroughs E101) in 1958 and was one of the inventors of the Fast Fourier transform algorithm. Georges Lemaître Located 30 km south of Brussels, Louvain-la-Neuve is a truly unique city. The town was created in the 70\u2019s with the sole purpose of hosting the university, when Belgium\u2019s evolution towards federalism led to the institution of two independent universities, one in Flanders, the other in Wallonie. It was decided that the city should not be only inhabited by students, but rather draw a diverse community, as is found in any classic city. The city center is built on a gigantic concrete slab, with cars travelling and parking underground. The ground level is mostly car free and organized as a Middle Ages city, with small tortuous streets and passages, stairs, squares and gardens. The pedestrian area is expanding even far from the city centre. The characteristic small two-to-five floor buildings made of red bricks are continuously expanding for nearly 50 years now, around few iconic buildings (the Science Library being one of them). Set up in Louvain-la-Neuve, the Centre for Cosmology, Particle Physics and Phenomenology (CP3) hosts research on particle detectors, high energy particle physics, phenomenology, theory of the fundamental interactions and cosmology, equally strongly on the experimental and theoretical fronts. The aim of the Centre is to bring together researchers in these scientific fields and to encourage collaboration. Following a long tradition in theoretical research in the phenomenology of the elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, their unification, and the theoretical and mathematical problems that these issues raise, CP3 members\u2019 activities cover a wide range of fields in fundamental physics, from high energy particle physics to our Universe\u2019s history, from CP-violation in weak decays to tests of general relativity at cosmological scales. They also draw heavily on rich and fascinating fields in theoretical physics and mathematics. Involved in CERN experiments since the 60\u2019s, the CP3 experimental group holds a strong expertise in instrumentation, software and data analysis techniques. Presently engaged in the operation and exploitation of the CMS detector at the LHC, CP3 members have contributed to the construction, technical qualification and commissioning of the CMS silicon tracker. Physicists from CP3 are involved in top physics, (BSM) Higgs studies, exotic physics searches (e.g. HSCP), gamma-gamma interactions, etc. The Centre also has a long tradition in scientific software development. FeynRules, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, Delphes, and MoMEMta are MC tools being developed at CP3. In the context of the AMVA4NewPhysics network, we are working on MoMEMta, a tool to use the Matrix Element Method in data analysis. This is the first of a series of posts that will publish the results of artistic work by high-school students of three schools in Venice, who participate in a contest and exposition connected to the initiative \u201cArt and Science across Italy\u201c, an initiative of the network CREATIONS, funded by the Horizon 2020 programme of the EU. The AMVA4NewPhysics network is sponsoring and directing the artistic production in Venice, which has taken place at Liceo Stefanini, Liceo Foscarini, and Liceo Benedetti, involving over seventy 3rd and 4th year students. The production has ended this month, and following a pre-selection of the 12 best works, an exposition will take place during the week of July 5th-12th at the Palazzo del Casinò of the Lido of Venice, in conjunction with the international EPS conference in high-energy physics. Finally, at 9PM on July 8th, at the Sala Perla of the Casino of Venice, the best artworks will be given prizes in the presence of the Director General of CERN, dr. Fabiola Gianotti. The prizes are offered by the AMVA4NewPhysics network. Here I present the first work, titled \u201cSub-lime\u201d. It is the work of Alice Deppieri and Carlotta Dal Zennaro. In a short chat I had with them when I visited their school today, they say: \u201cIn this work we have tried to simplify the visual description of a particle collision, to reach the maximum possible audience. We have used recycled materials in our assembly.\u201c I believe the very careful construction and the choice of colours and materials makes this work very aesthetically pleasing. In the pictures below you can see the work and some details. I will update the post with a picture of the artists with their work as soon as they give me a consent (they are under 18 years old). This work was selected to be exposed to the Casinò di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. I would like to encourage everybody who reads this post to please leave a comment in the thread, offering their own judgement of the composition. Thanks! And here are the authors with their work: This is the second installment of a series of posts that will publish the results of artistic work by high-school students of three schools in Venice, who participate in a contest and exposition connected to the initiative \u201cArt and Science across Italy\u201c, an initiative of the network CREATIONS, funded by the Horizon 2020 programme of the EU. The AMVA4NewPhysics network is sponsoring and directing the artistic production in Venice, which has taken place at Liceo Stefanini, Liceo Foscarini, and Liceo Benedetti, involving over seventy 3rd and 4th year students. The production has ended this month, and following a pre-selection of the 12 best works, an exposition will take place during the week of July 5th-12th at the Palazzo del Casinò of the Lido of Venice, in conjunction with the international EPS conference in high-energy physics. Finally, at 9PM on July 8th, at the Sala Perla of the Casino of Venice, the best artworks will be given prizes in the presence of the Director General of CERN, dr. Fabiola Gianotti. The prizes are offered by the AMVA4NewPhysics network. The artwork presented here, produced by Angela Molena and Filippo Forcella, both students from class IV TB of the Liceo Stefanini, is titled \u201cSimmetrie\u201d (Symmetries). This is a three-dimensional assembly, produced with recycled and poor materials. In the words of the authors, \u201cWe could analyze particles produced in a collision at the LHC, and present them with threads of different colours and different composition, representing their characteristics. The assembly was rather complex, it was tricky to keep it equilibrium the central structure. We only used strictly recycled material.\u201d I appreciated a lot the effort the students put in creating a truly three-dimensional view of a particle collision. The sides of the structure are also decorated with a two-dimensional projection of the event display and with a sketch of the detector seen from a side, with led lights giving it a touch of technology.                            And finally, here are the authors with their work: Today Ivan Bianchi, professor of Contemporary art at the University of Padova, visited along with the AMVA4NewPhysics network coordinator the Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d in Venice, to assess the status of the projects produced by the students for the \u201cArte & Scienza\u201d contest. The project has been described previously. In a nutshell, it foresees artistic work by high-school students, inspured by high-energy physics at the LHC and the Higgs boson discovery. The best artworks will be exposed during the EPS conference at the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of the Lido of Venice between July 5th and July 13th, and the three winning ones will receive prizes sponsored by the AMVA4NewPhysics network. The quality of the works, some of which already completed, others close to completion, was found excellent. It looks like it will be difficult to select those that will be exposed during EPS. In this post we present one work by Lilian Mendicino and Denise Patrizi, titled \u201cL\u2019universo tra le dita\u201d (The universe between my fingers). The work represents Peter Higgs, his hands holding a collision event generating the Higgs boson. It is produced in three-dimensions with iron wire on a black wooden stand. Working with iron wire it is challenging to give 3D feeling to the assembly, but the students have done a great job. The pictures unfortunately do not convey very well the real appearance of the sculpture. The artists also produced a text to explain their work. Here is a quick and dirty translation: This work has been conceived such that, through the use of simple materials such as iron wire, complex concepts can emerge. In this sculpture are represented hands that hold the graphical representation of the collision between particles; they can be interpreted as Man holding between his hands the quality of his discoveries. Particles this small may be detected in the study of proton collisions, but the probability to put them in evidence are tiny. This is why we decided to make them permanent with this sculpture \u2013 to pay tribute to who in such a big universe has sought for the tiniest things. This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. Here are the artists with their work, and some close-ups:                                           AMVA4NewPhysics has a little brother, INSIGHTS. The latter is in fact young but not so little, as it starts big: it is a new ITN that has just been approved and will be funded for four years with 3.14 million euros, starting in September 2017. Like AMVA4NewPhysics, INSIGHTS is a child of the marriage of particle physics and statistics, and like AMVA4NewPhysics it will train highly-skilled graduate students on a wide range of topics, bringing interdisciplinarity into their genes. Finally, like its older brother, INSIGHTS has INFN as a beneficiary partner, and it will bring funding to its Naples and Padova section, in the latter case with Dorigo, who is also the scientific coordinator of AMVA4NewPhysics, as PI. It is important to recall that the whole concept of the ITN institution, one of the \u201cMarie-Curie Actions\u201d of the Research Executive Agency (REA) of the EU for the Horizon2020 programme, is to create \u201clasting structures\u201d of innovative training for Ph.D. students in Europe. But how can one create a lasting structure with a time-constrained, if generous, funding ? The solution, which I think the REA implicitly accepts when it selects the projects to fund, is to allow successful projects to be resubmitted, as well as to give trust to credible projects that claim synergy with others already underway. Indeed, when the INSIGHTS project was written, its editors were careful to include mentions of possible synergies (co-organization of training events, knowledge exchange, common outreach) with AMVA4NewPhysics. I think these synergies are potentially very useful. For example, AMVA4NewPhysics plans to organize a workshop in statistics toward the end of its lifetime. A successful workshop costs a lot of effort to be organized, as well as money (e.g. to invite keynote speakers). Here is a concrete example of something that can be created by a joint effort with INSIGHTS \u2013 as the latter also has similar events in its programme. Working together, this may become a much better event! The synergy is also implicit in the overlap of the scientific program of the two networks. In fact, INFN -a beneficiary of both ITNs- aims at doing research with CMS data in both. In general, many members of the two networks already cooperate in the experiments they belong to. So things will run smoothly in this respect. For now, this blog welcomes the new network and congratulates with its scientific coordinator, Prof. Glen Cowan of the Royal Holloway University in London. The network includes 10 more beneficiaries and 6 partners. More information on its composition will be given when the network starts.   Yesterday I visited the Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d of Venice, where 40 students are preparing their artwork for a project of communicating science with art that will culminate in an exhibit at the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of the Lido of Venice, during the week of the EPS conference in July. The project (titled \u201cArte e Scienza: i Colori del Bosone di Higgs\u201d \u2013 art and science: the colours of the Higgs boson) has been discussed in more detail in previous posts here, so I will not go in details here. I visited the school during one of the meetings Â of the students with their art teacher, and had a nice \u201cturn of the table\u201d where the students explained what are the projects they are working at. Then there were questions, and one question in particular (on the Higgs boson: \u201cif they say the Higgs boson exists in space and permeates it, why do we need these machines to produce it?\u201d) deserved an articulated answer. I had a set of slides that could do that quite well, so I attached my laptop and projected them on the large screen of the Aula Magna. Unfortunately I needed to point to specific areas of the slides, and the screen was big. So I needed a pointer, and there was none in sight. A student came up with an umbrella and I accepted to use it \u2013 generating hilarity in the audience, but reaching my goal. Only later did I discover that I did have in my backpack my very nice \u201canalogic\u201d telescopic pointer, which would have served the purpose at least as well, without making me feel a bit silly. Oh well \u2013 results are what matters! On the plus side, I was able to understand that many students are planning interesting works. In a month or so we will put together a web page with a display of all the works, properly commented. So stay tuned! You will have a chance of commenting on which artwork you prefer, before they are preselected for the EPS exhibit\u2026 The fifth artwork presented here for the series \u201cArt & Science\u201d (see previous posts for more details of this art contest, connected to the EPS 2017 conference) is actually titled \u201cToward the Boson and Beyond\u201d. It is the result of collaboration of three students of the Liceo Marco Foscarini in Venice: Chiara Chiapatti, Micol Zhu, and Ludovica Violato. The students designed and realized a way to imagine a particle collision using a telescope. You thus get to literally immerse yourself in the beam pipe of the LHC, and -like a modern-day Geiger or Marsden- glimpse at the flash of light that a Higgs boson leaves when it is produced and decays. The high quality of technical work that went into producing the instrument is surprising. If you pick it up if has a feel similar to a real monocular \u2013 it is not flimsy or with moving parts as you would imagine from an artisanal creation. So both the idea and its realization are commendable! This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. Below you can see a few pictures of the object, as well as a video that sort of gives you the idea of what you see when you look inside the thing.                                              Here is a video showing what you see inside the scope:   And below are the authors of the work: Chiara Cattelan and Lorenzo Banchieri, two students of Liceo Marco Foscarini in Venice, are the authors of the work presented in this post, which along with the others presented in the former posts partecipates in the artistic contest for the EPS 2017 conference, organized by the EU project \u201cCREATIONS\u201d and sponsored by our network. The two young artists have conceived an installation made up by two canvases set up back to back, one representing a LHC detectorzooming into the collision region, and the other representing the big bang. The center of the action is a hole in the canvases, at which center resides a small plastic ball suspended by a thread. The ball can be jolted by the observer, ideally providing the collision energy, and thereby \u201clit up\u201d in flashes of bright blue, yellow and red colour. On the opposite side, a translucent screen visualizes the effect of the collision projecting those dancing colours. The idea is quite neat and the realization actually very mature for artists of such young age. This is certainly a work deserving careful consideration for the contest! In fact, the work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. Below you can see some pictures and detailed views.                                              And below is a short video illustrating the effect of the led ball on the translucent screen: By Tommaso Dorigo The project \u201cArt and Science: the colours of the Higgs boson\u201d is in full swing in Venice, where 15 to 17-year-old students from three schools (the Liceo Stefanini, the Liceo Foscarini and the Liceo Benedetti) are producing artwork inspired by the CMS experiment and the Higgs boson. In this blog we already reported of conferences held at the schools by the Ph.D. students of the AMVA4NewPhysics network in January. Â Now it is time for the students to build on the inspiration provided by those lectures and by the images of particle collisions, detector pieces, and Feynman diagrams. Today I visited the students who participate to the project at Liceo Foscarini, and gave some hints and suggestions to the students on how to design their work \u2013 of course, leaving them as free as possible to invent something. Below are a few pictures of the students, who gathered in the PC room to collect material from the web and to discuss and develop their projects in small groups. It was very nice to see that the students are indeed taking the challenge in the way it was imagined. I could witness some of them pondering on Feynman diagrams, others wondering how to interpret graphs with musical melodies, still others designing structures that will probably never see the light because of their dimensions \u2013 in that case I suggested that they should \u201cthink concept\u201d rather than \u201cthink big\u201d, for practical reasons (the artwork will have to be transportable, among other things\u2026). I look forward to presenting the results in this blog!                                                                            This evening (April 14) I am blogging from a residence in Sesto val Pusteria, a beautiful mountain village in the Italian Alps. I came here for a few days of rest after a crazy work schedule in the past few days -the reason why my blogging has been intermittent. Sesto is surrounded by glorious mountains, and hiking around here is marvelous. But right now, as I sip a non-alcoholic beer (pretty good), chilling off after a day out, my thoughts are focused 500,000,000 kilometers away. As an amateur astronomer since the age of seven, I have always loved to watch the night sky and its treasures. Nowadays I do that very infrequently, however, as work is a tyrant. But really the real reason why my observing sessions are rare is that I have grown picky. I cannot be content with watching the sky from a urban or suburban location: I want the best. There are places around Sesto where the background luminosity of the night sky is very low, which allows amateur telescopes like mine (a 16 inch dobsonian) to see wonderful details in the arms of many galaxies. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why I came here. In April, the constellation of Libra is up at nigth for northern observers, and with it a cluster of galaxies which is a real wonder to behold with medium to large telescopes (I remember counting 13 different galaxies in the same field of view by aiming at the center of the cluster). This evening, however, the moon will rise shortly after midnight, preventing a real serious galaxy observing session. So what is up? It is Jupiter, the biggest planet of our solar system. Jupiter is these days at its closest point to the Earth, so observing it is easier. The planet has been a favourite target of observers since Galileo first aimed his rudimentary telescope at it in 1610 (forgive me if I don\u2019t know the exact date). When I was a kid, the pictures that even giant telescopes like Mt. Palomar could snatch of the gas giant were blurry and indefinite -there was no technology to acquire digital images and stack the best shots, nor adaptive optics to react to varying atmospherical conditions in the field of view. And then came the first images from the probes we sent to the planet, and it was like, wow! THAT\u2019s what those features we observe from Earth really look like! Nowadays the planet is the subject of deep studies with the probes we send there, like Juno. But even modest equipment allows skilled amateurs to obtain pictures that were impossible for 5-meter telescopes twenty years before. And if you are a skilled amateur and you have access to a 1 meter telescope \u2013 well, Â what you can do is amazing. Judge for yourself e.g. from the video below, obtained by Damian Peach last February by collating many fantastic images. (the image isÂ Copyright D. Peach/Chilescope Team.Â 1 metre telescope with ASI174MM camera.) Â  I do not pretend to be able to see similar details on Jupiter\u2019s disk with my 16 incher. But tonight, if the sky clears, I will be aiming it at the planet with doubled interest. The reason is that the largest of the four main satellites of Jupiter, Ganymede, will pass in front of the disk as seen from the Earth, leaving a crisp dark shadow that can be followed during the three hours it takes to travel from one side to the other. It is a unforgettable view if you happen to see it. The forecast says there will be clouds tonight, but the sky should clear up at some point. So I am praying for this to happen before 2AM, when the transit of Ganymede will end\u2026 I will let you know the result soon. UPDATE (Apr 15): I am happy to report that the clouds finally left a window of opportunity after midnight, and I was able to follow the full transit of Ganymede and its shadow. The nice thing is that the seeing was surprisingly very good, allowing me to use 300x magnification and observe many small details on the tormented face of the planet. I could discern, for instance, three small white oval storms on the south-south-tropical band, which I later found in recent online pictures. The nice thing was observing the satellite, a tiny but discernible disc, a little brigther than the background of the NNTB, trailed by its shadow. This gave three-dimensionality to the view. When I dismounted the telescope and went to bed I was extremely satisfied to have stuck there watching layer after layer of clouds passing by\u2026 The picture on the right shows more or less the kind of detail I could see, and the placement of Ganymede as I could see it on the planet\u2019s disk. At 300x the planet had an angular appearance of about 4.5 degrees, i.e. nine times the full moon (credit: Valentin Lyakhovic). And below, I attach a picture which shows me (ok a few years ago \u0111 with my telescope.   Update \u2013 after downloading some 30\u201d footage I took \u201cjust for the sake of it\u201d with a cellphone by attaching it to the eyepiece, I found that most of the time the planet was badly overexposed. I could only extract one snapshot which shows much less than what I could see at the eyepiece (e.g. the disk of Ganymede is not visible), but still gives some idea\u2026 Here it is on the left. You can see some banding on the planet and the black dot due to Ganymede\u2019s shadow. On the bottom right is Callisto. GSI, the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, is a laboratory located near the town of Darmstadt, in central Germany, just a few miles away from the Frankfurt airport. The centre was founded in 1969, and has since then been a very active facility where heavy elements are studied (six rare heavy ones were in fact discovered there, including the one they named Darmstadtium!), and where a wide research plan of nuclear physics is carried out. I visited the lab on April 25th and 26th to give a seminar there, invited there by my recent acquaintance, prof. Peter Braun-Munzinger. This is from my series of talks titled \u201cExtraordinary Claims: the 0.000029% Solution\u201d, where I discuss the five-sigma criterion in HEP and tangentially publicize my recent book, \u201cAnomaly!\u201d. I was extremely happy of my visit, as my host Anton Andronic, a researcher at GSI, planned everything perfectly and gave me a tour of the lab as well as a short walk through the town of Darmstadt, which is surprisingly full of interesting things to see. The laboratory is immersed in a country scenery of woods and lakes, but is a very active place in continuous expansion. The plan is to build a new accelerator for heavy ions, FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research), which will include a new synchrotron, a super-fragment separator, and many other rings for nuclear matter and antimatter studies. These devices will become operational in 2025, and construction is in full swing \u2013 the civil engineering is quite complex per se, as the soil is sandy and unstable, so the accelerator complex, which stands at ground level, must be sustained by 1-meter concrete columns that dig deep in the ground. I was able to see and touch many pieces of hardware while touring through the complex. Just like an enthusiastic amateur, I took several pictures \u2013 I think that even if you do not actually understand what these things are and what they do, they\u2019re amazing to watch. Take for instance this crystal ball, made by two half-spheres of photomultiplier-scintillator bars: (The picture is upside-down by mistake but I decided to keep it this way, as a sphere does not care which side you look at from!). Or take this giant \u201cgreen cube\u201d which hosts a supercomputer centre: This reaction chamber is also quite amazing to see, isn\u2019t it ? My host Anton explained to me many details of the research that is being done at GSI. As a member of the ALICE collaboration, the focus of his research is rather the study of quark-gluon plasma in LHC collisions (he is working at charge particle multiplicity distributions and J/Psi decays to electron pairs), but we rather discussed the physics of production of very heavy nuclei, their stability, and the experimental methods to study them. One thing I was very interested to visit was the cancer irradiation facility they have at GSI. They treated several thousand patients with Carbon ions (Carbon has a very sharp energy deposition in matter \u2013 its \u201cBragg peak\u201d is quite narrow \u2013 so by tuning the beam parameters you can irradiate tumors residing deep down organic tissue without harming the surrounding organs), but the facility is not used anymore. Anton explained to me that there\u2019s an \u201cethical\u201d aspect of deciding whether to treat patients with proton beams or carbon beams: the latter are five times more expensive and complex, so you need to choose whether to treat five times fewer patients with a better device or what. In the end nuclear physics is quite a different topic from high-energy particle physics, but the means of investigation of nuclear states are pretty similar. We are all \u201cspectroscopists\u201d \u2013 we look for energy and mass spectra in search for bound states of matter in exotic configurations. So my seminar was arguably interesting to the audience, as it focuses more on the methods rather than on the physics. Or so it seemed to me. As for me, my visit was definitely worth, as I learned a few things and made friends with a very special colleague. Thanks Anton! [This post first appeared on 4/27 in my http://www.science20.com blog] Today we finalized a revision to a document detailing the progress of the AMVA4NewPhysics network \u2013 it is called \u201cProgress Report\u201d and is a deliverable, something that the Research Executive Agency of the EU expects networks to produce by a specific time. In the document the action of the network is carefully described in all its facets. In drafting the revision of the document, we came across some statistics that we think is interesting to share here. It concerns the 10 recruitment calls we made to hire the 10 ESR (early-stage researchers, aka Ph.D. students in the ITN). By looking into the demographics of the applications one gains some insight in the \u201cprior distribution\u201d of applicants to these positions. Overall, we received 181 applications. This is not a large number \u2013 an average of 18.1 per call! It is surprising that these ITN positions do not receive a higher level of attention from graduate students, especially since the salary level and the conditions are designed to be competitive in the PhD market. On the other hand, the timing of the calls may have played a role here, as there are times of the year when students apply for PhD positions, and we opened many of our calls in antithesis to that season. Of the 181 applications, only 120 were deemed valid. This is maybe not surprising, as there are several \u201cfine-print\u201d conditions that are to be met by applicants. In particular, there is a rule demanding that less than four years of research time must have passed since the time of achievement of the master-level diploma. Also tricky is the rule that requires the applicants to NOT have resided in the country where the position is offered, for the previous three years. This \u201cmobility rule\u201d aims at encouraging students to travel abroad to improve their experience and knowledge. We also found that several applications lacked the required backing of reference letters, something that is unfortunately reflecting badly on the professors and staff members that the applicants turned to, rather than on the applicants themselves. 25% of the valid applications were by female students. This number is more or less what we expected \u2013 it is actually slightly higher than the average female fraction in exact sciences, something we could attribute to the explicit encouragement of applications by females in our calls. Of the 10 hired ESRs, 4 are females, so 40% \u2013 this might be seen as a proof that the female applicants were on average better than the male ones, but might also be an effect caused by our explicit action in favouring female applicants. The geographic distribution of the applications is also interesting to look at. Of 120 valid applications, 36.7% were from European applicants, and 38.3% from Asian applicants. Then African ones (15.8%) and only 9.2% of American ones (adding up North and South). While it is hard to \u201crenormalize\u201d the Asian and African numbers, it is interesting to observe that the American applications were significantly lower than European ones. The number of graduate students from Europe and the Americas is of the same order of magnitude, so the 4:1 bias in favor of European applicants must have reasons connected to ease and appeal of relocation / language, as well as accessibility of the calls. Overall the applicants from the US in particular were very few \u2013 probably the offer of good PhDs there is too high to make the ITN system appealing the US nationals.   Today is March 8th \u2013 the day internationally devoted to women. And we in AMVA4NewPhysics are sensitive to the subject of raising awareness in the themes of relevance to this day across the world. Discrimination of people based on sex is just as bad as it is any other form of discrimination (based on creed, race, and other categorizations). And we know that women in practically all countries of the world suffer from discrimination that causes them to receive lower wages for the same job, to have fewer chances of career advancement, to have fewer job opportunities, to have worse access to education. On top of that there\u2019s the oppression that some societies operate systemically on women, there is violence on women, there are hostile mindsets, preconceived opinions on alleged inferiority, and other psychological hindrances. All of the above is everybody\u2019s business. The first job in front of us, in order to fight this perverted state of affairs, is to recognize that it exists and that it is a problem for all of us. We do not have to be females to realize this: if we are males, it is our business because we have a responsibility and we can help change this; and we may have daughters and wish that they can live in a more equal society, one where they can enjoy the same freedom, the same safety as men, and one where they can be appreciated for their work and skills as much as our sons do. In science, things are not any better than in society at large: there are discriminations everywhere we turn \u2013 from grading systems of our students, to hiring practices, to career progression. E.g., a study of European graders of math tests recently showed how female students got worse grades for the same kind of test than their male companions.  Or we can quote the fraction of female physicists \u2013 since this is the subject of our research. This stays in the 10-30% range, depending on the categories we investigate. AMVA4NewPhysics has been serious from the very start in striving for gender neutrality and in encouraging women to apply to our ESR positions. Three of the original eight beneficiaries of our network are female, and so is our Supervisory Board chair (Prof. Daniela Bortoletto, one of the highest ranked physicists in the world according to several different metrics \u2013 it does not take a gender neutral network to select her to lead us!). And we made an effort to encourage the application of female students to our positions \u2013 getting the very encouraging result that four of our ten ESRs are female! (pats himself on the back). Now on March 8th we can ask ourselves what else are we doing for gender neutrality in Science, and a good way to also realize what is the situation and what are the prospects is to ask our own female students for a view of the issue. On the first topic: we are going to have a \u201csoft skills\u201d workshop next year when we will educate our students on gender neutrality issues. We are also going to try and facilitate our female ESRs in their career development plan \u2013 but hey, that\u2019s something we do for the male ESRs too. What we certainly can do, I believe, is to keep this topic at the center of our attention and to keep thinking of ways to propagate a simple bit of information to the younger generations: being a scientist is cool, and it is a good service to today\u2019s society, and being a scientist is a female job at least as much as it is a male job! Below I attach a couple of quotes from two of our female ESRs, who were quick enough to provide input on the matter on a short notice (my inspiration for writing this post was an article I got to read this afternoon here). Cecilia Tosciri, Oxford\u2019s ESR in AMVA4NewPhysics, thus summarizes her thoughts on the matter today: \u201cI believe that nothing but science can give comprehensive and consistent answers to the deep questions of our life. For this reason I decided to pursue a career in particle physics. Today, as a member of CERN, I am involved in the most exciting working environment that a particle physicist could claim. I believe that every person can achieve major objectives such as this one, as long as there is passion, dedication and resolution. Regardless of gender. Women can leave their mark as much as men, in every field, science included.\u201d The picture on the right shows Cecilia giving a lecture to high-school students in Venice one month ago. And here\u2019s Ioanna Papavergou, our latest addition to the ESR pool, recently hired by IASA in Athens: \u201cIt is very inspiring and hopeful that the scientific community has become a prime example of what can be achieved when aiming for gender equality.\u201d Ioanna (above) has impressed us by deciding to move to Amsterdam three years ago for a master in Astrophysics, a topic quite different from her laurea thesis topic in Athens. Now she is back to Athens and back to particle physics, and we expect a lot from her! As for Alessia Saggio (right), our ESR in the Louvain node of the network, here is her take: \u201cAt the age of 14 I was keen on literature and music. That was the main reason why I chose to pursue classical studies at High School, studying Latin, Greek and Italian literature and taking piano lessons in the meanwhile, with the perspective of becoming a writer or a perhaps pianist some day. The thought of physics never crossed my mind. Still today I can\u2019t figure out if it was, unconsciously, because of the common stereotype that women are not good in science or because some other reason came into play. Anyway, as I started attending some physics lectures during my fourth year of High School, reading about the LHC and talking a lot with my teacher, I actually realized what my future life would be about: physics, science, research. I knew that only few girls decide to pursue a scientific career, but that didn\u2019t stop me. Maybe because I don\u2019t like stereotypes\u2026 To be honest, I didn\u2019t have to face many issues with the fact of being a girl and doing physics, so far. But my case could be a lucky one: stereotypes are hard to kill and it\u2019s true that in general we are not considered as good as men at doing science. So girls, if science is what you want to do, please take a step forward and get your chance: science needs us as well!\u201d And to conclude, let me quote our Supervisory Board chair Daniela Bortoletto (right): \u201cI am passionate about my job. I have worked at particle accelerators all over the world probing higher and higher energies. I have participated in the discovery of the top quark at the Tevatron collider in the US and more recently in the discovery of the Higgs boson at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.  These discoveries have led to the completion of the standard model of particle physics. Nonetheless the particles of this model explain less than 20% of the matter in the universe, leaving many open mysteries. Being a particle physicists is amazing because we need to build extremely large complex detectors to study these tiny particles. I am currently working on ATLAS, which is the biggest experiment that mankind has built. Its construction and operation has brought together some of the most talented scientists from all over the world working peacefully and constructively to pursue this beautiful science. I dedicate myself with passion to the development of strategies to increase the participation of women in physics. I have organized the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics in the UK which I hope will contribute to the creation of a new generation of women leaders in physics and help leveling the playing field in my discipline.\u201d This afternoon I gave another lesson on particle physics and the discovery of the Higgs boson to a score ofÂ selected students of Liceo Foscarini who decided to participate to the project \u201cArte e Scienza\u201d (which I described in a former post). While exactly two months ago we have an attendance of almost 200 students to the lecture I gave with Cecilia Tosciri and the other ESRs, today the audience consisted only in those 20 students who decided to take on the challenge of producing artwork inspired by particle physics. And they proved very interested in the matter! Indeed, lecturing high schoolers on particle physics is a bit of a gamble every time. Sometimes you encounter highly motivated audiences, while in some other occasions the number of students who really follow the lesson is a minority. I guess it both depends on the students themselves and on their teachers \u2013 inspirational science teachers are always capable to motivate their students to learn more about scientific topics. This time the contact at the school was prof. Alvise Varagnolo, who has a background in theoretical physics and has even been a researcher in supersymmetric theories in the past. Given his enthusiasm with the topic I did expect an interested audience. And I was not disappointed. Since the students in the audience had already assisted to a generic lecture on particle physics two months ago, I decided to focus on a few selected topics, trying to get to the heart of the matter. I discussed the standard model, its mathematical formulation (in general terms, but pointing out the capability to calculate reaction rates with Feynman diagrams and interaction Lagrangians), and the working principle of accelerators and detectors. And then I was able to touch on the challenging detection of a Higgs boson signal. From the many excellent questions I received (why colliding protons and not other particles? How do we know the various decay modes of the Higgs boson? How does one construct the mass histogram from four-lepton decays? etcetera) I gather they did follow my talk with attention. The students will now take on the challenge of producing artwork inspired by particle physics and the Higgs boson discovery. Together with some 100 other students from two other schools in the Venice area, they will compete to get their artwork exposed during the EPS 2017 conference at the Lido of Venice. The best works will be rewarded with consumer electronics offered by the AMVA4NewPhysics network. It will certainly be a very interesting spring! It is with a certain satisfaction that I can announce today that the AMVA4NewPhysics network is in complete control of its planned schedule, and has now started to provide real research-grade output, delivering its first two scientific products of relevance. Deliverable 1.1 (from work package 1, which focuses on MVA applications to Higgs boson studies) and Deliverable 4.1 (from work package 4, which focuses on the development of entirely new Machine Learning tools with in mind their application to specific HEP problems) have been submitted on February 27th, with one full day of advance with respect to their due date (hehm). Here I want to give you access to Deliverable 1.1, which is a public report. It is a 60-page document, so I expect it to be of interest only to those of you who are also doing Higgs boson studies at the LHC. Nevertheless, I encourage you to give it a look. It is a pretty damn good study, resulting from the efforts of more than half of the early-stage researchers who are working for the network. The title of the report is \u201cMultivariate Analysis Methods for Higgs Boson Searches at the Large Hadron Collider\u201c. What we focus on, as foreseen in the network programme, is the decay of Higgs boson to tau lepton pairs and to bottom quark pairs. The process of interest is the production of Higgs boson pairs in 13 TeV LHC proton-proton collisions, a topic to which in particular three of the network institutions have turned their eyes in the recent past. The reason for studying Higgs pair production \u2013 a very rare process, that takes place only once every 10^13 collisions! \u2013 is that it is the main avenue for determining a crucial parameter of the standard model: the self-coupling of the Higgs boson with itself. Only if we measure that parameter to be equal to the standard model prediction will be satisfied with the 125 GeV boson we discovered in 2012 being really, really the particle we expect it to be. On the other hand, many new physics models might make the parameter different, so its precise measurement is extremely valuable science. So what have we done in the past year, and recently documented in the above report ? We studied how events with four b-quark jets, or events with two tau leptons and two b-quark jets, can be selected to evidence a signal of Higgs pair decay. The Higgs decay to b quarks takes place 66% of the time and so it is the most advantageous to focus on, given that the rate of the production is so small to begin with; but tau leptons, to which Higgs bosons decay at a much smaller relative rate (off the top of my head I can\u2019t remember the exact number \u2013 it must be in the 1-2 percent range), offer a more distinctive experimental signature. Background reduction is the name of the game, and so classification is the tool. We need to use all the available observable characteristics of the events to determine whether the events smell like Higgs pair decays or like backgrounds \u2013 which are mainly due to QCD multijet production in the case of the four-b final state, and to top pair production in the case of the tau-tau-b-b final state. What the ESR of the network have done, with help from other staff members, was to simulate large datasets of signal and background with a publically available package, DELPHES (which, by the way, is a product from members of one of the network nodes, Universit\u0102\u0160 Catholique de Louvain). Then, for the tau-tau-b-b signature the students considered deep neural network architectures and advanced boosted decision trees implementations, and constructed complex sequential procedures, first regressing some important variables to the most likely real value, and then using the output of the regression step in a powerful neural network. For the b-b-b-b signature they considered different architectures, finding the most performing ones, and they studied regression of the dijet masses (the \u201cmoney variable\u201d in a H->bb decay search) to improve the signal\u2019s observability. In the graph below, for instance, is shown the result of multi-stage regression of the di-Higgs boson mass (the four-body mass) calculated from observed four-momenta of the tau leptons and bottom-quark jets. On the top is shown the difference between true and measured value of the di-Higgs mass at various stages of the correction (the red curve being the final result), on the bottom panel is shown the distribution for signal and background; the signal distribution is compared to the true value to show the excellent performance of the regression procedure. Please note how separated the background and the signal become after the regression ! So, in summary the results are very encouraging, and they beg us to carry out the same studies on fully reconstructed, private simulations of ATLAS and CMS detector data. Which, of course, cannot be distributed as a network product \u2013 that is why we used DELPHES samples, which allowed us to carry out the work in cooperation in a group of network members that includes members of both collaborations, plus theorists, plus statisticians. The next step is to produce at least a preprint article from the material. This will take a few more weeks at least. Yet for today we can say: mission accomplished!   While I was busy reporting the talks at the \u201cNeutrino Telescope\u201d Â conference in Venice, LHCb released a startling new result, which I have not much time to describe in much detail this evening (it\u2019s Friday evening here in Italy and I\u2019m going to call the week off), and yet wish to share with you as soon as possible. The spectroscopy of low- and intermediate-mass hadrons (whatever this means) is a complex topic which either enthuses particle physicists or bores them to death. There are two reasons for this dycothomic behaviour. On one hand, the fact that new hadron resonances may appear out of the blue if you apply the right selection on collider data, and their true nature can then hit you between the eyes (the signal is then called to \u201cpass the interocular stress test\u201d): no issue of systematics or sculpting of background can then be raised, the signal is genuine and an evaluation of the p-value of the data under the null hypothesis is ridiculous. It can be exhilarating to find such a signal in your data! On the other hand, the advancement in our knowledge of particle phenomenology we get from discovering new resonances is usually scarce or null. The problem is that we have a very good theory, QCD, but we cannot calculate anything with it at low energy, so we cannot compare it with what we observe and check whether we have found new effects \u2013 new physics \u2013 or just regular new hadrons belonging to schemes already understood fifty years ago. Now look at the graph below, courtesy LHCb. Is it not the prettiest you\u2019ve seen in a long time ? In it you can see clear as they can be five distinct sets of events whose nature is clear: they are resonances of well-defined mass and natural width. The analysis details allow you to understand that these all are \u201cOmega_c baryons\u201d \u2013 particles containing two strange quarks and one charm quark. Their different masses are explained by different orbital motions of the quarks in the three-body systems, or still more intricate detailed phenomenology. Now, when I showed this picture from my cellphone to Carlo Rubbia, while we were having lunch at the Neutrino Telescopes conference in Venice today, he shrugged his shoulders: \u201cnon serve a niente\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s useless, he said. What the\u2026?!!! I was a bit disturbed by his statement at first. Useless ? It\u2019s an advancement of our knowledge of hadron spectroscopy. And yet, Rubbia has a point. Little or no additional knowledge besides the very quantities that have been measured \u2013 five masses and five natural widths \u2013 can be extracted from this observation. Or maybe more, and I would be very happy if some QCD phenomenologist stepped in here and explained it to us in the comments thread\u2026 So you get Rubbia\u2019s point: as pretty as these new resonances are, they do not add much to our knowledge. And Rubbia wants to know the neutrino mass hierarchy, and he wants to know whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles, and he wants to know if there are sterile neutrinos. These are the questions he is working on \u2013 as he is still active with Liquid Argon detectors for these studies, with the ICARUS T600 tank being carried at Fermilab soon. Indeed, one might argue that while the LHC will not discover anything \u2013 not at the high-energy frontier with ATLAS and CMS, nor in low-energy spectroscopy with LHCb, nor with heavy ion messy collisions \u2013 the real meal to be had is in neutrino physics. Neutrino masses are indeed the very first signal of new physics beyond the standard model, if you spin it in one particular way. I used to say that the observation that neutrinos have a nonzero mass caused just a rearrangement in our understanding, and not a revolution; much like moving around the furniture in your apartment cannot be called having changed home. But in truth, there seems to be more to be learned in neutrino experiments these days\u2026 At least, this is my bit of wisdom after one week of brainwashing at the neutel 2017 conference. If you visit the blog at http://neutel11.wordpress.com, you will find there over 40 new articles I wrote to summarize the talks given there this week, plus 12 posters presented at the conference. If you are interested, do not fail to give a look! And here it is, the second \u2013 but really synchronous in publication with the first \u2013 scientific deliverable of our network. Deliverable 4.1, titled \u201cReport of the Performance of Algorithms for Data-Driven Background Shape Modeling\u201c, is a report of studies performed by network members operating within Work Package 4, also known as \u201cNew Statistical Learning Tools for HEP Analysis\u201c. The research presented in this document aims at constructing a precise representation of background processes to searches for small signals in hadron collider data. Specifically, we focused on the multijet QCD background, which is a process whereby proton-proton collisions yield a large (>=4) number of hadronic jets. Since the same signature is of interest for the study of many rare phenomena of interest in high-energy physics at the LHC, and since the absolute rate of background processes is much larger than that of all those potential signals, the precise modeling of the multijet background is a very important tool for us. In this report we considered three background-estimating methods entirely based on real data \u2013 thus removing the need to deal with the limitations of Monte Carlo simulations, which struggle with the complexity of the final state (introducing systematic uncertainties) and its large production rate (where CPU limits introduce statistical uncertainties). While the first one, known as \u201cmatrix-based b-tagging rate parametrization\u201d is not a Statistical Learning algorithm per se, and is only discussed as a reference point and as an historical introduction to the topic, the other two belong to the area of supervised learning. In the end, the report discusses in the greatest detail a method which is entirely new and has been developed specifically for the needs of the AMVA4NewPhysics programme. ItÂ is called \u201chemisphere mixing\u201d, and is based on the construction of an artificial dataset by exploiting the approximate independence of the two final-state partons emitted, in the leading-order approximation, in QCD collisions; these are \u201ctwo-to-two\u201d processes \u2013 either space-like or time-like. At leading order, the two partons are emitted back-to-back in azimuth with equal transverse momenta, thus creating a \u201ctransverse thrust axis\u201d which can be effectively recognized also at detector reconstruction level and used as a reference value to split the event in two almost independent parts. The intricacies of color radiation, multiple gluon emission, forward and backward evolution, pileup effects, multiple parton scattering, and what have you, all conspire to make a multijet event quite complex to handle. And yet, if one can see a simplicity in the complexity, by considering the transverse thrust axis, one can devise a method to exploit it. In the graphs below is given a quick visual illustration of the procedure, which consists in creating a library of hemisperes (half events constructed by cutting data events orthogonally to their transverse thrust), which is then parsed to create \u201cmixed events\u201d. The mixed sample retains all the interesting kinematical features of the original one, allowing for a very precise and fully data-driven model. I do not venture to explain its working in detail here though, so you will have to download the report if you want to know the details! The method is verified to work with the help of a formal statistical hypothesis testing approach. The test is quite complex and interesting to read about by itself. The method is found quite suitable for the applications we have in mind \u2013 namely, the search for Higgs pair production in the four b-quark final state, a process that is also the focus of the other deliverable just released by the network, D1.1 (you can read about that one, and download it here). Below (left) you can see a comparison of background shapes for some kinematic variables in the original dataset (blue) and the artificial one (in red \u2013 almost invisible as it\u2019s completely overlaid!). The densities are compared on the left, and the ratio between them is shown in the right panels, highlighting the effectiveness of the model. Congratulations to all AMVA4NewPhysics members involved! And on to the next due reports, which are due at the end of August!       Below is a short summary of the IML workshop at CERN, which Markus Stoye has also reported on in the previous post. Day 1 was a discussion with industry experts about the state and future of ML. In the afternoon there was work on the community white-paper that the IML plans to publish. This document is meant to be a road-map for where we want HEP to be in 10 years time with regards to ML. The proto-document is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o9S0XE4ly4-LZh9y96DG-U7HH61m2cHboV6xSt1tI0g/edit#heading=h.l4vnrli7pz7r and we are encouraged to contribute to it. There\u2019s also a dedicated Google group here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-cwp-machine-learning Day 2 there were presentations from HEP experiments on flavour tagging algorithms using ML; some very nice results! The afternoon had short introductions on new TMVA developments and a Scikit Learn tutorial. Day 3 had presentations of more general tagging algorithms as well as tutorials on Keras and R. The agenda with the presentations may be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/595059/other-view?view=standard_inline_minutes There was also a quark/gluon jet classification challenge being run throughout the workshop as part of an initiative to introduce \u2018standard, public data-sets\u2019 for comparing ML solutions (think HEP MNIST). Happy to report that yours truly came third, but further submissions are accepted. Send pull requests to https://gitlab.cern.ch/IML-WG/IMLWorkshop2017-Challenge, an explanation of the challenge and links to the data are also on that page. The AMVA4NewPhysics network has reached month 17, and its third solar year in existence. It is time, I think, to make a short summary of what has been going on until now, before we concentrate our attention on what lies ahead. Overall, if we look at the plan as its authors designed it in the fall of 2014, we see an impressive level of agreement. This is by no means a trivial statement! Writing a successful ITN project involves making a number of predictions about the future, and imagining the development of research and training beyond what is usually possible. Hence the coincidence of plan and actual action is to be remarked. Let me list below some of the things that went perfectly along according to the plan, and also things that required some steering, to summarize what we have left behind our back. \u2013 We had three well-attended and fruitful supervisory board meetings in close temporal match with the schedule. The first was held at CERN in September 2015, the second in Venice in March 2016, and the third last December in Oxford. While the first meeting was mainly organizational and focus on warming up our muscles, the second focused on maximizing the network members\u2019 participation and creating a public engagement opportunity (which was absolutely a success, with Daniela Bortoletto\u2019s lecture with music and refreshments to an audience of 150 laypersons!). That event also allowed us to get acquainted with the Project Officer of the REA (Research Executive Agency of the EU), our supervisor and counselor. As for the third meeting in Oxford, we started to shift our focus on research output, with many interesting scientific discussions taking place in the perfect atmosphere of a well-functioning network. \u2013 We are proceeding along the plan with our outreach action: this blog has established itself as a place where outsiders can read what is the life of an early-stage researcher doing his or her PhD in particle physics or statistics in a EU network, and learn some physics and machine learning in the meantime. Our press office coordinator Sabine Hemmer has been instrumental in making this possible. Of course, keeping the blog lively requires a constant effort from all the parties involved \u2013 something I never tire to explain to our students and network members! \u2013 Speaking of outreach, I should also mention the twitter account @AMVA4NP and its hashtag #AMVA4NP. Thanks to our outreach officer Pietro Vischia the tweeting action continues steadily, although I believe we should aim for a different setup whereby everybody can contribute to it more directly. \u2013 Outreach goes along well with Dissemination. Here I can confidently say that we over-delivered, as we decided to invest network funds to sponsor a parallel session at a physics conference in Thessaloniki last September, something we had not foreseen in the proposal (and something which could not be promised in good faith there!). Indeed, hijacking a physics conference to add a parallel session titled \u201cStatistical methods for physics analysis in the XXI century\u201d was a rather unconventional and hard-to-implement move. We were however quite successful, as the session sported 17 excellent presentations by leading experts on the field, and attracted a significant interest. In fact there are thoughts of repeating that feat in the near future. \u2013 A number of other products have appeared in 2016 thanks to the network action. I should certainly mention the important MoMeMta software package, to which ESR Alessia Saggio and the Louvain group contributed significantly, the preliminary result of a CMS search for HH->bbbb decays to which ESR Pablo de Castro gave a crucial input with INFN-PD, a similar result by Oxford for ATLAS, the publication of a proceedings paper on a new ML tool for anomaly detection by Pietro Vischia from Oviedo, the talk by University of Padova\u2019s Bruno Scarpa in Thessaloniki on Bayesian non-parametric classification methods, Pablo\u2019s similar talk on a new background-shape estimation method in the same venue, the issuing of an internal CMS note on the same topic, the production of a innovative flavor-tagging algorithm by the CERN group with the contribution of ESR Anna Stakia\u2026 And I could go on. \u2013 Secondments in partner companies have started as scheduled (although a couple have been delayed for technical reasons): ESR Pablo de Castro visited SDG in Milano, where he developed visualization tools for topological multiscale analysis; and ESR Alessia Saggio spent three months in B12 working at ML applications for specific problems of that company. Other inter-beneficiary secondments have also taken place exactly as scheduled: several ESRs met in Oxford and Padova to produce simulated samples of data for the study of classification and regression algorithms, and ESR Grzegorz Kotkowski visited CERN for two months, to learn about physics (he is the only statistician ESR in the network) and to study the statistical properties of one important algorithm we are about to deliver. \u2013 Recruitment has followed the plan, but here the road has been bumpier than anticipated, for a couple of reasons. In IASA there has been a delay due to the change of PI of the node (many thanks to Niki Saoulidou for her outstandingÂ work as equal opportunities officer as former PI in IASA, and welcome to Constantinos Vellidis as new PI!), and the ESR there is going to be hired this month, with a delay of a few months which will however not impact the network plan. And TUM (Technische Universitat Munchen) has become a new beneficiary because of the new position as associate Professor that was achieved by Andreas Weiler there (congratulations Andreas!); the change caused a delay of hiring of the ESR who will work with Andreas, who has been selected and will start working for AMVA4NewPhysics in a few weeks. \u2013 As far as events go, we were very successful. We organized a Machine Learning and MATLAB course at CERN which was open to everybody free of charge, and was taught by a true expert in the field, MathWorks\u2019 Ilya Narsky, a former particle physicist. The event attracted a very large participation (in fact we had to find a larger conference room than anticipated!) and was very well received. We also sponsored a Statistics School by IN2P3 in Autrans, where network members Donini and Dorigo gave lectures. As foreseen in our plan we benefited from the Erice School of Science Journalism by having our press office coordinator Sabine attend it (she won a grant to attend the event so it did not even cause the network to pay for her participation!). We sent our ESRs to the Yandex school of data analysis in Lund as foreseen. One ESR attended a conference in Crete (ICNFP) in July, and gave a talk in Thessaloniki in another (I know I said that already, but it is important to stress this!). Louvain organized workshops in matrix-element methods. One member of INFN-PD, Martino dall\u2019Osso, was selected to show a network product (the analysis of HH->bbbb) at a conference in China. Oxford wrote a paper on the use of neural networks for the selection of higgs pair production. And I am surely forgetting things here\u2026 A lot has happened in 2016, really! With 2016 behind our backs, we can surely be confident on our means for this year. The first thing to worry about is the successful delivery of three important deliverables: the organization of a Soft Skills workshop, which will take place in Padova on February 1 to 3, and will see the participation of most of our ESRs plus seven PhD students from the department of Physics and Astronomy in Padova. And two documents describing classification and regression tools for the Higgs search, and background modeling methods using MVA. Work on these deliverables is intensely going on, but we need to converge now! Farther along, I should mention the secondment of Pablo and Anna at the Center for Machine Learning in UCI, where they will benefit from the great knowledge of our partner Daniel Whiteson. Another thing coming soon, which is going to turn into a new success and a further proof of over-delivery of our outstanding ITN network, is the participation through a sponsorship to the international EPS conference, which will take place in the Lido of Venice in July 2017. Being a member of the local organizing committee of that conference I was able to offer the contribution of our network to help organize the involvement of high-school students in Venice, by offering lectures by our ESRs and a competition for the production of artwork by the students, inspired by the physics gadgets and research we do at the LHC. The plan is the following: ESRs will give talks to high-school students participating in the initiative at schools in Venice (the Liceo Foscarini, the Benedetti-Tommaseo, the Marco Polo, the Stefanini, and the Bruno-Franchetti) at the end of January. These will include showing inspiring visuals (event display, detector pictures) Students will form small groups and together they will spend several hours in the months of February, March and April to produce their artwork. The hours spent in this project will count for the \u201cAlternanza Scuola Lavoro\u201d that Italian students have to attend to in the last years of high school. a committee formed by a member of the CREATIONS EU network, Dorigo, and the professor of Contemporary Art in Padova Ivan Bianchi, plus local professor from the schools, will select the best artwork in each school. The selected works will be exhibited in July at the venue of the EPS conference. There, a final selection will identify the recipients of prizes \u2013 consumer electronics gadgetry (offered by the network with its sponsorship). As you see, this is an innovative way to do public engagement, and it kills several birds with the same stone: we do outreach, we collaborate to make EPS 2017 a success, we allow our ESRs to train themselves to speak in public, and we deliver one product we promised to the EU \u2013 in fact the lectures by ESRs in high schools is a deliverable of our network! Besides the above, much more is in store\u2026 So stay tuned for more chapters of our challenging adventure! Another way to image the collision between LHC protons giving rise to the Higgs boson: it is the subject that an all-ladies trio formed by Beatrice Lazzarini, Giulia Lucibello, and Francesca Piazzalonga took as the starting point to design their sculpture, which they dubbed \u201cHiggs\u2019 Eye\u201d because of the resulting similarity of the finished composition to an eye, at the center of which lies the Higgs boson. They used iron wire to create a spiral within which the collision takes place, which in their mind symbolizes its capture in a contained place, clay, as well as coloured enamel to paint the various outgoing particle tracks produced in the collisions. This work was selected to be exposed during the EPS conference at the Palazzo del Casin\u0102\u02db of Lido, from July 5th to 12th. Along with 16 others produced by Venice high-school students it participates in the contest for the best works. The work named \u201cAttimo\u201d (or \u201cinstant\u201d in English) was produced by Nicol\u0102\u02db Doglioni, Filippo Dorigo, and Zeno Pogaznic from Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d. They were impressed by the pictures of the CMS detector and its components, and they decided to try and capture the symmetry of the detection elements in a way that makes it only apparent if you happen to end up in the correct line of sight. The attached pictures show the construction, made of coloured wood and iron wire, and two of the authors (Dorigo and Doglioni) in front of their creation. This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. The high-school students participating in the \u201cArt & Science\u201d contest participated in at least two lectures on particle physics and the LHC experiments before being asked to start designing their artwork. One of the challenges was to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d and not feel constrained by what they could imagine was expected from them: they could conceive paintings and sculptures, of course (most of the groups ended up creating sculptures), but other creations were possible: photographs, performances, videos, etcetera. Among the few groups who proposed something original from the standpoint of the kind of \u201cmeans of communication\u201d is one from Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d composed by Martina Ciampi and Elena Murer. They were inspired by the graphs used by physicists to report their data in the form of histograms \u2013 such as the one of the Higgs boson discovery shown on the right. Since they are musicians, they decided to \u201cread\u201d those complicated graphs as if they were partitures of music. The result is a quite interesting collection of melodies: the number of events collected in each bin of a distribution get translated in a one-to-one map to sounds, and the artists become executors of these cyphers. The idea turns out to be quite original (something similar, music extracted from raw data, was attempted at CERN by some researchers, but this is different) and the result is a very interesting video. The students associated to their sounds some computer-generated images showing a graphical dance of particles. Some of the effects are beautiful and the result is quite commendable. Check it out for yourself below\u2026 This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students.     The rather uninspired title of the twelfth artistic work presented here should not deceive you \u2013 this is a very creative effort by three students Marta Vianello, Federica Vianello, and Emma Coglitore of Liceo Benedetti of Venice, who participate in the \u201cArte e Scienza\u201d project of the CREATIONS network, to which AMVA4NewPhysics collaborates. The painting is composed by mixed techniques employing a variety of materials, including buttons, beads, paint, and other elements arranged to create a display of a LHC collision in a very colorful arrangement. While the authors have decided to remain faithful to the original inspiration material they were provided during the introductory seminars (where many event display of collisions were shown, and from which they certainly took the general layout of the presented work), they have indeed interpreted in a personal way the realization of the assembly, which has a quite pleasing appearance. You can see the painting in the images below.             \u201cLa Collisione\u201d \u2013 the collision \u2013 is the title of another event-display-inspired work by students of Liceo Benedetti in Venice, Ludovica Don\u0102  and Licia Memo. The students decided to employ discarded bits and pieces of colored glass to create a collage representing a LHC collision. Murano glass is a very well-known artistic product of Venice, so this choice connotates their work and localizes it in its provenance. The choice of glass fragments was explicitated by the students to symbolize the creation of Higgs bosons, as glass fragments like Higgs bosons are produced from the sudden breaking of a continuum \u2013 glass, or the vacuum. This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. I believe the result of their effort is really aesthetically pleasing and the work is thus commendable. You can see it in the pictures below. The last of the set of 10 works produced by students of Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d \u2013 in this case Vittoria Toresin, who chose to work alone \u2013 is titled \u201cSpots of Light\u201d. Her work consists in a painting created with fluorescent powders of different colour. The originality of this creation is thus evident from the outset. Vittoria chose to represent a particle collision with a set of different techniques and colours. In this way, she deconstructed the event in the sum of the different created particle trajectories and energy releases, each of which got represented by a different colour and with a different sign on the canvas. The result is a spectacular view that should be appreciated in dim light \u2013 the assemblers of the exposition will have a hard time figuring out how to best place the painting. An intense lamp will also need to be placed in front of the painting and lit up every few hours, to allow the fluorescent paint to \u201crecharge\u201d. This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. The pictures below do not faithfully represent the artwork, which is best enjoyed in person. However, they give an idea of the effect in daylight and in obscurity.   Below are the powders used for the painting: And below is a sketch (\u201cprova d\u2019autore\u201d) produced by Vittoria when she was still in the design phase of her artwork. It is an interesting observation that a very small fraction of the Venice high-school students who prepared artworks for the \u201cArt & Science Across Italy\u201d initiative of the CREATIONS network Â produced paintings. I am sure that if you polled 15 to 17 year olds around, asking them \u201cgive me an example of an artwork\u201d, most would respond \u201ca painting\u201d. And yet, they shied away from it. I suspect that the main factor in their choice of expressing themselves through other art forms is that a painting is seen as something you can do only if you can paint well; creating an image exposes you to more direct criticism from your peer than creating an abstract assembly or some 3D concoction. The work presented here is one of the few paintings produced by the Venice students. These are Giammarco De Bortoli and Jean-Zacharie Mariethoz, from Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d. Their painting, produced with an aerograph, is in bright complementary colors. They provide the following explanation of the image they produced (in a quick translation, of which you will forgive the inaccuracy): \u201cIn order to understand matter at a subatomic level, humans are limited to collide it with other matter and observe the result. Similarly the artists, putting the unknown object between themselves and the canvas, spray color, getting to represent only an ill-defined figure that leaves a trace of the subject of the investigation.\u201d The result is shown below. Is it a painting or a sculpture ? While it can definitely be hung on a wall, I would rather classify \u201cEye\u201d as a sculpture than a painting. The three students of Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d who produced the artwork presented here are Asia Andrianelli, Federico Avanzi and Ilaria Buricelli. They assembled over a board painted in lucid black an image that was inspired by a picture of a section of the LHC collider. They reasoned that through that device man can look with Science into the subnuclear world, like an electronic eye. The materials used are cardboard, wood, acrilic paint, nails, cotton thread, and electric wires and glass. You can see it in the pictures below. Another painting, produced by Tommaso Bacco, Antonio Labranca, and Luca Roncali, all students of Liceo Benedetti, is the one titled \u201cThe order of chaos\u201d and presented below. They chose to represent a particle collision with a mix of paint strokes and color droplets in Pollockian fashion. The result is indeed chaotic, but not devoid of some pleasing balance between the employed hues and the black backdrop. Â The title of this surprising sculpture is \u201cIl teatro del bosone\u201d (the boson theatre). It is the work of three high-school students of Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d in Venice who, like many of their peers, decided to render in a three-dimensional way the colourful particle collision images they had been shown during the initial seminars of the \u201cArt & Science\u201d project. At variance from other teams, however, they found a rather interesting solution to the three-dimensional challenge. The team assembled layers of plexiglass over which they painted drops of colours, as if taking snapshots of particles exiting the collision point at different instants. The final product of the students\u2019 work is a neat plexiglass box which you can peek in to discern the elusive signal of the LHC collision. The result is very hard to capture with a camera, as the layers of plexiglass reflect light in obnoxious ways; the sculpture is much better observed in real life. The authors of the work are Francesco Fuin, Francesco Ramazzotto, and Giorgio Neri. Their sculpture has been selected to be displayed at the exposition that will take place at the Casin\u0102\u02db di Lido of Venice during the EPS conference, from July 5th to 12th.   Mariam Taufiq and Denzel Aragd, two students of Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d in Venice, are the authors of the work presented here. For some reason they found some connection between the LHC proton-proton collisions that give rise to the production of Higgs bosons and the festivities of Christmas, and they decided to create an artwork that puts the two things together. Their canvas shows an explosion of white and cyan over a black background, with blue leds decorate the picture as if it were a Christmas tree. Barnaba de Carli and Orsola Zambelli, two students from Liceo Benedetti in Venice, are the authors of the painting they called \u201cBoson on Canvas\u201d. They added to their own interpretation of a proton-proton collision some LED lights, so the work should be set on a dimly lit wall. For the benefit of those of you who have no previous notion of what this is related to:  \u201cArt & Science Across Italy\u201d is a project of the EU network CREATIONS, that challenges high-school students to produce artwork inspired by lectures in LHC physics they receive in an initial phase. The AMVA4NewPhysics network has contributed by working with five schools in the Venice area, involving 323 students. 80 of them ended up producing artworks, a total of 38 among paintings, sculptures, and videos. The 17 best works will contribute to an exposition at the palazzo del Casinò at the Lido of Venice, during the EPS conference from July 5th to 12th. A prize-giving ceremony will take place on July 8th in the presence of the CERN director general Fabiola Gianotti (h21, Sala Perla, Casinò del Lido di Venezia). And now two pictures of the work discussed above:   Continuing the series of posts displaying artwork by high-school students of the Venice area, the pictures below illustrate a work done by Francesco Barbato, Â Asia Colmagro, and Alice Sanguin, students of the Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d. The students devised a slightly critical work, which is well described in a few sentences they put together in a flyer they produced along with their \u201cGarbage Particle Accelerator\u201d, a plastic cylinder that does resemble a bit a garbage can. In their flyer they write: \u201cHow much waste do we have in our world? How much time and money do we invest in a technology such as particle accelerators? Is this the right choice of investment? We discussed about it\u2026 And we ended up creating a garbage particle accelerator Hoping that it will make you think about it as well\u201d. I do not know if their work made me think about the matter, but for sure it forced me to point out to the students that there are many other ways that we spend our money in (tax money, that\u2019s what we are talking about). One year of research in Physics is paid by one day of budget by the US defense department, for instance. Or one year of money spent for tarot readers in Italy would pay for a brand new LHC. In any case, the matter would deserve more discussion than this post allows, so let us just concentrate on the artistic value of the work. In the pictures below you can have a look yourselves. The cylinder has a transparent window that allows to peek inside, where particles are symbolized by spheres of different colours. Many of the high school students participating in the Art & Science contest in Venice took inspiration from the pictures of LHC collisions creating the Higgs boson, and attempted to produce a three-dimensional realization of what physicists only realize on their computer screens. The work shown here, produced by Eleonora Perale and Camilla Longo, is probably the one of the lot that reproduces with most care one of the \u201cviews\u201d that CMS uses for its event displays. By translating into three dimensions the collision picture, they had to wisely choose the materials that would allow the most pleasing, while faithful, result. They used iron wire mesh and colored polystirene for the calorimeter, and wool thread for the inner tracker. Judge by yourself the result in the pictures below. Pietro Costantini, Gabriel Taormina, and Giulia Zago are the authors of the work titled \u201cThe Particle\u201d. The three high-school students of Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d imagined that the Higgs boson had been \u201ccaptured\u201d inside a strange box they put together with canvas and chains. The work should be hung from above to be properly exposed. The pictures, unfortunately, fail to show the work well \u2013 it was a bit difficult to image it.       Perhaps one of the most original creations of the whole set of artworks presented for the \u201cArte e Scienza\u201d contest in Venice is the work shown here, which was produced by Jacopo Zanetti, Matteo Nucci, and Tommaso Talamo from Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d. Along with three videos their work is a veritable \u201cperformance art\u201d of the set, in fact. It is unfortunate that they did not take a video to document their production process, which is even more interesting from an artistic point of view than the photographic result. The students went to a dark place at night, and put some steel wool inside a cooking whisk. They set the wool on fire, and rotated the whisk in front of a camera set with long exposure, creating images that resemble their interpretation of a Higgs production event. I must say I like a lot the idea, but again, a video would maybe have been even more attractive. Anyway, the pictures are shown below. Judge for yourself (and apologies for the lousy pictures \u2013 I could not avoid the lights from reflecting on the photo surface). Arvin Albertini, Francesco Poggi, and Linda Scarpa from the Liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d are the authors of a inspired artwork with an uninspired title, \u201cThe Higgs Boson\u201d. This is a sculpture consisting in a square box within which are placed two hands \u201cpointing\u201d to the center, where wool threads of different colour originate. They so describe their work: \u201cThe Higgs boson is also known as \u2018god particle\u2019, and it is exactly this surname that better inspired us to realize a work in which art and science coexist. Hands, in fact, clearly allude to \u2018Adam\u2019s creation\u2019 by Michelangelo, and it is this imperceptible space between the two fingers, so rich with tension, of atmosphere, and at the same time unabridgeable, that arises in us the deepest doubts on the mysteries of human genesis. So the Higgs boson, set at the center of the composition exactly between the two pointing fingers, acquires a more precise meaning: from one side it constitutes the scientific progress and on the other side it establishes a concrete point of contact between art and science. Two disciplines that have always been mysteriously fascinating.\u201d This work is one of the 17 from Venice high-school students that were selected to be exposed at the EPS conference in July. You can see it below. Yesterday the last artworks by Venice high-school students were screened and selected for the art exhibit that will be installed during the EPS conference next month. In total, 38 works have been produced by over 70 students from five institutes. The work presented here is a video, produced by Matteo Carraro, Nicol\u0102\u02db Patrizio and Giovanni Felisi, of the liceo \u201cBenedetti\u201d. The students, inspired by accelerator and particle physics notions they learned during the introductory lectures, created their video by imaging collisions of a special kind\u2026 The last frames give away the real nature of the pictured phenomenon. Judge by yourself! This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students.     Antonio Perri, Isabella Furlan, and Elisa di Paola, from Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d in Venice are the authors of the artwork presented here, which along with the previous ones shown in this blog have been produced for the \u201cArt & Science\u201d initiative previously described. The title offered above is only a name tag, as the artists did not provide one for their work. The object is a wooden surface with a representation of the LHC accelerator and one detector schematic, with CERN\u2019s logo and a zoom-in in the complex topology of a particle collision, represented with an entangled copper wire. A blue led light within the copper mesh gives a touch of colour to the composition.   The work presented in this post is authored by Sara Carletti, from the Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d. She took inspiration from the pictures of event displays in the CMS detector to imagine a way to convey the moment of creation of a discovery \u2013 pictured as a blossoming of flowers. Her representation of the collision starts with two coloured fuzz balls at the center, from which branches of flowers emerge in all directions. The flowers result where these interact with the detector cylinder. I think the idea is quite original, and its realization is quite pleasing. I am reminded of the title of an outreach book in particle physics: \u201cthe particle garden\u201d\u2026 This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students.     On September 8, 2017 the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova will host Astro@Stats 2017, a Sino-Italian Workshop on Astrostatistics. Aims and Scope Modern astronomy and cosmology heavily rely on statistical methods. At the same time, the recent explosion of available data, such as resulting from current and future astronomical sky surveys, provides unique challenges, and opportunities, to statistics. Several statistical challenges appearing in astrophysical research also arise in other fields of physics, such as particle physics. The aim of this workshop is to foster the interchange of ideas among astronomers, physicists and statisticians working at, and with, the University of Padova. The event has three sessions dedicated to academic talks by senior researchers, a junior speed session and a poster session open to a limited number of participants. The workshop is hosted by the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova, and is co-organized with the Department of Physics and Astronomy \u201cG. Galilei\u201d and the Confucius Institute Padova, with the endorsement of the University of Padova and the Guangzhou University. Call for Posters To present a poster, send a title and a half-page abstract in plain text (ASCII format) to astro2017@stat.unipd.it. Acceptance of the poster will be notified after the abstract review is completed. Preference will be given to early career researchers. Â Presentation of the poster is subject to prior registration. Poster submission deadline: July 28, 2017 To Register Registration to the workshop is open. Due to the limited places available it will be restricted to 80 participants. The conference fee amounts to 25 â\u0179, to be paid solely by credit card upon registration to the workshop.

The idea of the initiative is to explain to the public what projects active in the region where people lieve are being funded by the European Committee, as a means to inform and educate about what Europe really is. I do believe that these are trying times for the EU, with Brexit already a fact and other countries also showing stomach rumbles in their interiors. Right-wing parties try to sabotage the unity of Europe, and we must commit ourselves to acts of evangelization, explaining the good that is coming from this union. In fact, the whole concept of networking and transnational mobility that allows many scientific and training projects to be funded and function, is a great tool to sediment a feeling of belonging to a larger community and to build that interconnective tissue that makes a country what it is. The pictures below document the exposition of two posters at the department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova. One of the posters describes the generalities of the network and its goals, and the other describes in more detail the work being carried out at the UNIPD node. Similar posters are being prepared and will be affixed in all beneficiary nodes. In the meantime, we are also preparing informative flyers at INFN, and possibly an open-day event there. More about that in future posts. The picture below shows students looking at the poster describing the work of Grzegorz Kotkowski and the UNIPD node in the network. Here\u2019s another pic: Note that the poster has the banner \u201cEurope in my region\u201d \u2013 it has been produced explicitly for this purpose. Below is the more generalistic poster that describes the network in its entirety: With this post we reach the 50% mark in this series, as the number of works by Venice high-school students who participate in the Art & Science contest is 38. The work titled \u201cL\u2019umana macchina\u201d (the human machine) is a creation of Geremia Sassetto and Emma Bastianini, from Liceo Benedetti. They realized it with clay and iron wire. I think their work is quite commendable as the object has a pleasing appearance. To create a perfect sphere they deposited a layer of clay on a inflated ball, which they then pierced and removed. Inside the ball, they set led lights and colored filters, producing a nice effect once the thing is lit up in a dark place. They explained what drove them to realize their artwork in a text that can be thus translated: Humans have always observed the phenomena and elements making up the world around them. However, the Higgs boson cannot be observed directly \u2013 only its effects can be detected. Because of that, in our work the source of light is hidden within the sphere, and it is only what we see from the outside -the light seeping through the holes, that determines and guarantees its presence. The sphere is shaped as an eye bulb to symbolize the way we \u201csee\u201d and observe the Higgs boson. So here you have it \u2013 a pleasing sculpture, a lamp, an object of clean design, and also an inspired way to communicate particle physics! This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. The work presented here has not been given a title by its authors Vittoria Candiani, Maria Dalle Vacche, and Jacopo Lenarda. They used an old laptop computer as a support of a photograph they created using a long-exposure image of moving fluorescent sticks, and then overlayed it with a broken glass. In their description of the creative process, they explain that they were impressed by the computer-reconstructed images of particle collisions showing the possible creation of Higgs bosons. They thus tried to recreate that explosion in 20-second exposure of circularly moving fluorescent sticks on a dark background. The broken glass was overlaid to symbolize the powerful explosion that gives rise to the particle creation. Below you can see the result, and two of the authors in front of their work. Europe in My Region is a European Union-wide campaign encouraging citizens to discover European projects near them. In 2017, four different initiatives \u2013 project openings, a photo contest, a project hunt and a blogging contest \u2013 invite the public to visit projects, share images and experiences via social media. Thousands of EU projects open their doors mainly in May, a project hunt is organised from 2 May to 14 June, and a photo contest and a blogging contest run from 2 May to 28 August. In Padova we are trying to organize an open day to present to students and general public the various EU-funded research projects, among which the INFN contributes with a few, including AMVA4NewPhysics. For the time being, we have produced a couple of posters that describe the activities of the network. Below are a few pictures of the posters and bystanders and research personnel reading them.                                                          An assembly of wooden circles installed one inside the other, containing plastic rods of different colour, is the work by Alice Giambini, Matteo Quaglio, and Olga Pintus of Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d. The students took inspiration from the fact that the CMS detector is composed of several layers, each of which has the main function of detecting and measuring a different kind of particle. So they reproduced schematically the concept by having different \u201ccycles\u201d connected to different particle tracks (the plastic rods). These are distinguishable by color and shape (photons, e.g., are the yellow wiggles \u2013 taking inspiration from the way those particles are shown in Feynman diagrams). In the pictures below you can see the assembly, which requires a device to be hung from. The particles give a colorful realization of a collision event in CMS. The Art & Science project, which challenges high-school students to produce artwork inspired by LHC research and visuals, foresees that students work individually or at most in groups of three. The reason for this is that it is difficult to imagine a creative process with too many authors \u2013 there will always be some bystander in a numerous group, while the initiative wants to involve all the students in the production of artwork. The large majority of the groups of students from the Venice schools, who participated to the initiative with the goal of exposing their work at the Casin\u0102\u02db of Venice during the EPS 2017 conference next month, turned out to be composed of three students: they seem to want to work in groups, maybe to share the responsibility for the unusual task of producing some artistic output. But there have been exceptions. One such exception is Alexandra Cieol, from Liceo \u201cMarco Foscarini\u201d. She worked alone to produce the painting she titled \u201cIl tutto e l\u2019uno\u201d, which is presented along with the verses of a poem she also composed for the occasion. So you get a painting and an associated poem in this case. The painting pictures a fantasy view of a collision, so it is tightly connected to the theme of the challenge; the poem roams more free. In the pictures you can see both. I apologize but have not attempted a translation in English of the poem, for fear of doing too poor a job. This work was selected to be exposed to the Casin\u0102\u02db di Venezia at Lido during the EPS conference, July 5th to 12th, and it participates in the final selection of the best artworks by Venice high-school students. My activity as a chessplayer has seen a steady decline in the past three years, due to overwhelming work obligations. To play in chess tournaments at a decent level, you not only need to be physically fit and well trained for the occasion, but also have your mind free from other thoughts. Alas, I have been failing miserably in the second and third of the above requirements. So I have essentially retired from competitive chess, and my only connection to the chess world is through the occasional 5-minute blitz game over the internet. Recently a friend pointed me to a site, chess24.com, which has a rather nice interface. I soon started to play a few games per week there, realizing that my strength in quick games has not decreased that much. So I occasionally still play a decent game. That was e.g. the case this evening, when I was facing a French defense and I soon sacrificed a couple of queenside pawns in order to have the time to amass forces on the kingside for an attack. My opponent grabbed the material and when I further sacrificed a bishop, and then a full rook, was kind enough to oblige and take them, allowing me a quick and pretty finish. In the position below I am white and am to move. What would you play ? Tic-tac, the clock is ticking. As the display shows, I had fifty seconds to finish the game. Luckily I had seen the unorthodox solving move before sacrificing the material, and ended the thing in style. Still not seeing it ? The move you are looking for is a very unconventional one. Also, don\u2019t be lured by variations involving taking the bishop \u2013 the regained material will be of no use when black will mate you in g2 with his queen\u2026 The solution is simple: 1. Nh8+! which takes away the escaping square f7. The king must now go to h8 (little changes if black first interposes the bishop in g5, of course), and 2.Qg7++ is mate. For once, a nice finish to a game not devoid of some classical beauty\u2026 At 10:00 AM this morning, my smartphone alerted me that in two months I will have to deliver a thorough review on the physics of boson pairs \u2013 a 50 page thing which does not yet even exist in the world of ideas. So I have better start planning carefully my time in the next 60 days, to find at least two clean weeks where I may cram in the required concentration. That will be the hard part! Because of that, rather than an article about things that I know about boson pairs, this is a post about things I do not know well enough now, but on which my knowledge will see a rapid expansion in the near future. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I know the matter, from the history of research in this interesting sub-field of Standard Model and beyond-the-Standard-Model physics, to the most interesting recent results. But there\u2019s a big difference between knowing the boundaries and getting all the details sorted out in my mind, so that a clear picture can be drawn for a general reader. So, here\u2019s what you might be interested to know, too, about why the topic is exciting. First of all, let\u2019s dispel a misunderstanding: we are talking about pairs of elementary particles here, produced in particle collisions at accelerators. If you say \u201cboson pairs\u201d to a condensed matter physicist, e.g., you make him happy, as he will say he is the true expert on that field: why, he studies them day in and day out! In fact, bosons have the general property that they like to condense into a quantum state where every one of them has the identical same quantum numbers. So you can get helium-4 atoms to create a superconducting fluid, for instance, by exploiting that property if you cool the substance enough. Here, though, the bosons we study are elementary, and we only consider what happens when we produce them in energetic particle collisions. Or so I understood from the stipulation of the contract I signed for the review article I am going to write. The play So let me start from the beginning. The actors are the W boson and the Z boson \u2013 two particles discovered in 1983 by the UA1 experiment at CERN, which are indeed elementary and possess a spin equal to 1. That property makes them regular \u201cvector bosons\u201d (they are vectors because their spin possesses a direction in space, although the matter would be a bit more complex if we had to deepen it more). But wait. Two more particles belong to the cast. One is the photon \u2013 the quantum of electromagnetic radiation. Massless and with spin 1 as well, the  photon exhibits similar physics to W and Z bosons when studied as an elementary particle at colliders. And the other is the Higgs boson, the particle discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the 27 km synchrotron colliding protons at CERN. The Higgs boson here is the oddball: its spin is zero, so it is a scalar boson. The Higgs is the only elementary scalar particle we know, which makes it doubly interesting to study nowadays. We have four actors, and the main stage is the center of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC; other experiments have the right to claim they studied boson pairs, too, but they are only going to be minor players here. The simplified plot is the following: protons come in from two opposite directions at relativistic speeds, a pair of their constituents (quarks or gluons) interact, and two bosons come out with large energy, along with a lot of uninteresting debris. The two bosons then decay into stable particles (except if they are photons, as the photon is stable, thank God), and the detectors measure the energy and direction of the decay products. From that information, physicists can infer the production mechanism that took place in the proton-proton collision, and compare it to models. Self interaction There is in principle nothing very special about the above process \u2013 many other reactions are similarly studied by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations that way. But boson pairs have something interesting to tell us, in several ways. First of all, they can tell us how bosons self-interact. In other words, if you see a W and a Z boson emerge from a collision, you may be tempted to ask yourself whether what brought them to you was a collision that first created a single W boson with excess energy, and then that \u201coff-shell\u201d W boson (one with rest energy far exceeding its nominal mass) shrugged off the extra energy in the form of a Z boson. Taken as a single particle species, the \u201cweak boson\u201d category to which both W and Z belong, this radiation process is a  true self-interaction. By studying how often the process takes place we infer how strong that self-interaction is, and learn interesting bits of information about the inner workings of the Standard Model. Or, if we find that the rate of the process is abnormally high, we start to entertain thoughts that there is a new force at work, or that the model needs to be enlarged or modified by other new physics mechanisms. That is very interesting to us! So, we study boson pairs to picture the \u201cthree-boson vertex\u201d: a boson comes in, two come out. There is a whole literature about \u201canomalous gauge boson couplings\u201d that indeed deals with measurements of this self-interaction in all the possible declinations we are allowed to probe. So far, no anomaly has been detected, but we continue to look. Probing WW scattering to check whether it behaves With boson pairs there is a whole lot of other things you can do. A cool one is to study their scattering at high energy. Take two protons again, and imagine that they interact in a rare but possible way: rather than getting two of their constituents directly hit one another, each proton emits a W boson just before getting in touch with its counterpart. It may then be the two emitted W bosons that interact, creating what is called \u201cvector boson scattering\u201d. Now, again we are in the realm of the self-interaction of vector bosons, but here we are not interested directly in the \u201cthree boson vertex\u201d as above. We allow ourselves to consider all possible ways by means of which two W boson can scatter off one another. They may indeed fuse into a Z boson, and there you have a three-boson vertex and the consequent studies of self-interactions; but they may also interact by exchanging a photon, or a Higgs boson. Whatever they do, if they emerge at the end and get detected, we have access to a measurement of the reaction rate. It is now that things get interesting. Let me explain why. The Higgs boson was introduced in the early sixties by a bunch of visionary theorists who were dealing with several shortcomings of the theory setup then available. The Higgs field was the solution of the riddle of unifying the highly asymmetric situation of electromagnetic and weak interactions, when the weak W boson was thought to possess a very large mass while the photon (the quantum of the electromagnetic field) was hugely different, being exactly massless. By making the W a triplet of fields (W+, W-, and a new massive neutral boson, the Z) and by introducing the Higgs field with a funny \u201cmexican hat\u201d potential which has a circle of minima for non-zero values of the field, one allowed for the symmetry of weak and electromagnetic forces to be hidden from our view. That was by itself a miracle. But the introduction of the Higgs boson did more than that: it also allowed the restoring of a thing called \u201cunitarity\u201d of weak interactions at high energy. Without the Higgs boson, the scattering of two W bosons above a certain (large) energy would exceed some theoretical bound, making the whole theory look a bit dumb. The topic is rather advanced so I will not delve in it here; suffices to say that the Higgs boson is a true panacea for electroweak interactions, as it fixes many things in one shot! Now, with the LHC we are in the position of being able to actually verify whether the WW scattering does behave the way we expect, i.e. if the Higgs boson exchange keeps the reaction rate from diverging at high energy. This is something we have been recently able to start testing, and it is a very exciting new development of particle physics in the recent years. New particles But boson pairs yield much more than what I have been able to discuss above. In fact, they can be sensitive probes of new physics. For imagine there exists a massive new particle out there, which we have not yet been able to discover. It would be very hard to imagine that such a particle did not have any involvement with the weak interactions. So if it does, it can \u201ccouple\u201d to W and Z bosons. And in that case, it must decay, with some unknown but non-zero probability, into pairs of those particles. Now, here\u2019s another reason why collecting all the WW, WZ, and ZZ pairs we can (as well as pairs including the photon and the Higgs boson) is a fruitful occupation: by computing the invariant mass of those particles we have direct access to the measurement of the mass of the new particle. And since vector boson pairs are not very frequently produced in proton-proton collisions, they offer a not-so-background-ridden signature! That is why the searches for new resonances decaying into boson pairs is a hot topic nowadays at the LHC: dozens of scientific articles are produced yearly discussing the null results \u2013 which push the mass scale of new physics further and further. There are heaps of other very interesting things we can do with boson pairs\u2026 I realize I have not even scratched the surface yet. For instance I could talk of photon pairs, or Higgs boson pairs (the latter is the topic of the research I have been doing with the CMS experiment in the recent past). Or I could discuss how we have come to manage to reconstruct very high-energy boson pairs within a single observed jet of hadrons \u2013 a very recent and shocking realization, which has entirely revolutionized the field. Unfortunately, this article has become already a bit longer than I wanted it to be. So the four remaining readers who got to this line must excuse me if I leave those topics to another post. For me, writing this was a bit cathartic, as I wrote it in just 30 minutes without ever reading back what I had written. It tells me it will not be too hard to fill up 50 pages of text with just a bit more detail and rigor, and a few fancy pictures cut and paste from recent ATLAS or CMS publications! (this post first appeared in my blog, www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor ) Yesterday, October 20, was the international day of Statistics. I took inspiration from it to select a clip from chapter 7 of my book \u201cAnomaly! Collider physics and the quest for new phenomena at Fermilab\u201c which attempts to explain how physicists use the concept of statistical significance to give a quantitative meaning to their measurements of new effects. I hope you will enjoy it\u2026. \u2014- As we near the discussion of the discovery of the top quark, we need to make a digression to explain an important concept used by particle physicists to measure the level of surprise of an observation, i.e., how much are data at odds with a hypothesis. In a nutshell, the statistical significance of an observed effect (usually expressed as a \u201cnumber of sigma\u201d) is a function of the estimated probability to see an effect at least as surprising in the data. Z-values (as significances are sometimes called) and p-values (as statisticians name probabilities) are thus connected by a mathematical map, a one-to-one correspondence. As you are more familiar with the concept of probability, the way that map is constructed can be better explained by starting with an example involving probability estimates. You and your friend Peter go to a Casino one evening, and quickly lose track of one another, as you join a table of Craps, while he moves to a Roulette table. Your game that evening turns out to be a quite extraordinary one, as at some point you throw 10 naturals in a row. At the game of Craps, a natural occurs when the two dice show a combination among the set (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), or (5,6). A streak of 10 naturals is really uncommon, and as you later start looking for Peter, you cannot wait to report your feat. When you finally find him, Peter looks even more excited than you, and he is the first to explain what happened to him: at his Roulette table, he observed a sequence of 20 rouges (omitting the times when the neutral zero came out). Once you also report your experience, a nagging question unavoidably arises: should the sequence he witnessed be regarded as more, equally, or rather less surprising than yours? Admittedly, the surprise caused by an empirical observation can often be quite subjective. If, on the next day, you and Peter join a group of friends and tell them your Casino adventures, their answers to the question on the relative surprise level of the two observations might come in roughly equal proportions. Yet, there is of course only one right answer; the problem is mathematically well defined and can be solved by numerically comparing the probabilities of the two sequences of events. Since the throwing of the dice at the Craps table and the landing of the ball on the Roulette wheel may be supposed to be random processes, and each observed outcome should be independent of all others, then the probability of sequences of events is obtained in both cases as a simple product of relative frequencies. A natural occurs on average twice every nine trials, so the probability of the sequence of 10 naturals must be (2/9) to the 10th power, which is three-tenths of a millionth. For the Roulette sequence, the probability is instead (1/2) to the 20th power, which is just a bit less than one-millionth. Both series are thus quite unlikely, but in quantitative terms the sequence of dice throws is three times more unlikely than the sequence of rouges. If we were Casino managers in search of indicia of fraud, we would have to consider the dice throws a stronger notitia criminis of something awry than the Roulette results. The above example indicates that very uncommon sequences of events force us to deal with very small p-value estimates. Now, there is no problem when one writes a small number in a formula: scientific notation comes to the rescue, and powers of 10 elegantly substitute cluttering strings of zeros. So we succinctly write 5 x 10^-9 in place of 0.000000005, for instance. Still, when one talks of a small number, one prefers to avoid spelling out those exponents. When they have to deal with very large or very small numbers, scientists in fact introduce multiples or submultiples: this usually calls for the use of the suffixes kilo-, Mega-, Giga-, Tera- or milli-, micro-, nano-, pico-, and so on. For p-values, however, the standard conversion does not involve powers of 10, but a slightly more complicated recipe based on the size of the area under the tail of a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function, also called bell curve, is a cornerstone in statistics theory: it describes the typical probability distribution of measurement uncertainties. If you measure a physical quantity with an accurate instrument, the values you obtain by repeating the measurement usually scatter around the true value by following a Gaussian probability distribution, which characteristically predicts that larger and larger deviations are increasingly less frequent. The width of that Gaussian curve is proportional to the parameter called sigma, indicated by the Greek letter \u03c3. For a Gaussian measurement, the sigma parameter coincides with the standard deviation; a smaller sigma corresponds to a more precise instrument, i.e., one which returns an answer within a smaller interval. In fact, the standard deviation of a set of data is a measure of their typical spread around their mean. The conversion of a probability into the more manageable number of standard deviations \u2013 i.e., sigma units, or Z-values if you prefer \u2013 is performed by finding how far out in the tail of a Gaussian distribution, in units of sigma, one has to go in order that the area of the distribution from that point to infinity be equal to the stated probability. As a result of this procedure, a 16.3% probability can be seen to be equivalent to a one-standard deviation effect (boh-ring!); a 0.17% probability is a three-standard deviation effect (hmm, exciting!); and a 0.000029% probability corresponds to five standard deviations, five sigma (woo-hoo! a discovery!). Those numbers no doubt appear meaningless to you at first sight; yet, once you get familiar with the above correspondence, you will find it easy to assess statistical effects using Z-values. To see how, let me make one further example. When you report a deviation of an estimate from the reference value of a quantity you are measuring, you are accustomed to employ a unit appropriate to the measurement you are performing. So, for instance, for your body weight, you could use the kilogram. Upon stepping on a scale you might utter: \u201cI expected to weight 80 kg, but according to this goddamn thing it\u2019s 82!\u201d Note how this sentence is not very informative from a scientific standpoint, as it says nothing about the intrinsic precision of the instrument. Because of that, we cannot conclude that you have gained weight, as that conclusion depends on whether your scale measures weights with a standard deviation of, say, 2 kg, or rather 0.5 kg. In the former case, there is a sizable chance that your weight is actually 80 kg and the scale happened to report a measurement one standard deviation higher than the true value; while in the latter case, you have almost certainly been delusional about your body weight. A different way to report your measurement, one immediately providing information on the significance of the discrepancy, is to express the deviation as a Z-value. This is counted in units of sigma of the Gaussian distribution which corresponds to the precision of the instrument. Again, if sigma were 2 kg, which is exactly the difference between 82 and 80 kg, then Z would equal 1 and you would coolly say \u201cMy weight measurement today returned a value one sigma higher than I expected,\u201d which a statistics-savvy listener would not take as evidence for a weight gain. In fact, a statistical fluctuation of the measurement is a reasonable explanation of the discrepancy: a one-sigma or larger departure happens by mere chance 31.7% of the time, without the need for the true value of the measured quantity to have varied. If sigma equaled instead 0.5 kg, then 82 and 80 kg would be four sigma apart, so Z would equal 4; this could now be taken as strong indication that you have gained weight, as a four-sigma or larger fluctuation happens only 0.0063% of the time for a Gaussian measurement. I hope the above example allows you to appreciate the usefulness of relating deviations of a measurement from an expected value in sigma units. If I am alive, I probably owe it to my current very good physical shape. That does not mean I narrowly escaped a certain death; rather, it means that if I had been slower there are good chances I would have got hit by lightning, under arduous conditions, at 4300 meters of altitude. So, after this dramatic introduction, I hope I have hooked as many of you as possible, and I can start from the beginning the tale of what was meant to be a half-day excursion with no particular ambitions. I am spending a week in Quito, Ecuador, where I have been lecturing graduate students in astro-particle physics on the physics of the LHC and the results of the CMS detector. The school is the 7th edition of the \u201cCosmic Ray and Astroparticle Physics\u201d in Latin America; previous editions have taken place in Bolivia and Mexico. Ecuador is a nice little country cut in the middle by the equator \u2013 so the sun here rises exactly at 6AM, culminates at the zenith, and sets exactly at 6PM. The climate is quite stable, although precipitations have a minimum in August. In any case the forecast is impossible here, as the mountainous region has very irregular patterns of cloud formation. I landed in Quito last Saturday, and had time to get acquainted with the organizer, Nicolas Vasquez, and another lecturer from Desy, Johannes Knapp. Sunday was free, as the school would start on Monday morning, so I decided to make it count, to see something around. Before the trip, back in Italy, I had looked at the options and had decided against an excursion to the highest nearby volcano, the Cotopaxi. At 5830m of altitude, the volcano lends itself to very nice trekking, but in earnest I feared I would endanger my lectures by taking an enduring hike on the day before \u2013 so I had resigned to the idea of spending my free time by just visiting Quito and the surroundings. I chickened out, basically. Little did I know that maybe a guided tour of Cotopaxi would have been a better choice than what I ended up doing\u2026 My jetlag woke me up quite early on Sunday morning, and after spending a couple of hours on polishing my lecture slides, I decided to have a shot at the Teleferiqo, a cable car that brings on a nearby mountain from which a beautiful sight of the city can be had on good days. Quito stands at an altitude of 2800 meters above sea level, and the high point of the Teleferiqo is at about 3900. High altitude! For a guy with a craving for mountain adventures like me, this was a call I could not miss. So at 11AM I finally jumped on a cab and got to the boarding place, where I had to wait in line for over half an hour. Cursing silently for not having gotten there earlier, I finally got to the top at noon. The weather was very nice, with clouds around that prevented sunburns, but no threat in sight. In front of me stretched a path that seemed to proceed on top of a green ridge, Â all the way to the rocks of volcano Pichincha. I bought half a liter of water, put it in my backpack, and started to walk at a pace I used to be able to keep only when I was 20 \u2013 but as I said I am in good physical conditions these days\u2026 Pichincha (left) and Cumbre Rucu (right) from the Teleferiqo. The ridge approaching Cumbre Rucu is visible on the right. As for my backpack, it was a very small one, and it contained a k-way, a sweater, a thermic t-shirt, a packet of crackers, and sunglasses. Nothing else. Not the kind of equipment for a trek at over 4000 meters of altitude, but I thought I would walk for only a bit, maximum two hours, and then turn my back to wherever I\u2019d got and return to safety. I thought this would minimize my risks. Already at the lower station of the Teleferiqo, while waiting in line, I had had the occasion to read advices on how to behave. This included carrying stuff with me which I did not have (medical equipment, a knife, food), not trek alone as I was going to do, and be informed on the weather forecast, which I wasn\u2019t, but was useless anyway. Interestingly, the note also added advice on what to do if caught in a storm: avoid it at all costs, but if you do, lay down face down to minimize risks of lightning strikes, and do not stray away from the path if there is low visibility. As I kept walking I felt that proceeding at my usual speed was somehow harder than usual. Of course \u2013 only 30 hours before I had been at zero meters above sea level, in Venice, and here the lack of oxygen and the altitude were conspiring to make things challenging. I felt pain on my ears, but I insisted on keeping my usual pace, although my heartbeat kept peaking at 130-150 per minute, decreased as I slowed down a bit, and then got back there in less than five minutes. I am bradycardiac, with an average rest heartbeat of about 52, and I believe I will hardly die of a heart attack while exercising, so I was not too concerned by the fast heartbeat, but that gave me something to worry about for a while during my ascent. In the meantime, I was consistently overtaking all the other trekkers. \u201cJust as in the old days\u201d, I thought to myself. The path leading to the volcano As I kept going, I stopped to take pictures of the interesting flora and of the landscape. The peak was getting closer \u2013 I later learned it is the \u201cCumbre Rucu\u201d, a 4750m volcano that stands on the right of the Pichincha, and is closer to the end station of the Teleferiqo. I was starting to entertain the idea of getting to the top of it, but I had no idea of whether it was possible, and whether the path I was following was going there or what. I just enjoyed the trek, which soon became a bit more challenging. After reaching the edge of the rock which constituted the real peak of Cumbre Rucu, the path curves on the right, coasting its flank while rising steadily; then it makes a left turn and points straight to the top. Already on the flank there are a couple of passages where you can get discouraged from continuing if you\u2019re not accustomed to having your hands on the rock, as you have to shortly climb 5-10 meters up to overtake rocky interruptions of the otherwise simple path. On the first one I would meet, upon returning from the excursion, a couple of Americans who were unsure of what to do \u2013 he had a broken finger and seemed unable to climb confidently. I now hope they did not proceed, as I will explain later. The start of the path flanking the mountain Long story short, just before 2PM I reached the high point of the path, a saddle between two rocks. From there, a short climb of 50 more meters would bring me to the real top of Cumbre Rucu, but at that point I felt a bit exhausted, my shoes were not really meant for rock climbing, and I started to worry about my physical conditions on the next lecture day. So I decided to stick to the original plan \u2013 I was starting to get worried about making it back to the Teleferiqo before some nasty clouds could interfere. The valley and the Pichincha from the Cumbre Rucu. Besides, I could be proud of myself: I had made it to over 4600 meters of altitude, I could enjoy a wonderful landscape of the other side of the mountain, there was snow all around me, and there it came, a huge bird, who landed two meters away from me! I later learned it was a Caracara. Beautiful animal, and not scared in the least of my presence. I managed to take a few pictures of the bird, and fed it with a cracker. The Cara-cara landed at arm\u2019s reach Exhausted but happy, I pose next to the bird (in the background, on the right of my face) Soon I decided it was time to return. I blitzed down the steep, sandy slope I had come from, and soon reached the end of the more complicated part of the trek, where the long ridge starts. I was overtaking a few groups of other trekkers, most of which were also going back. The weather did not look any longer promising: a dark cloud could be seen above the city of Quito below me. I was proceeding fast, but as I heard the first thunder, and saw the bolt still far in the distance, I started to run. The last picture before the storm, looking back at the mountain Now, running is never a good idea in the mountains, for several reasons; the more so if you\u2019re 51 years old, and if you feel quite tired from three hours of high-pace trek. But I compared the various dangers and I decided that what I had to absolutely avoid was to be stuck on a ridge with a storm coming. As the path keeps on the edge of the slope, you are a very easy target for any electric discharge. Not good. So run, legs, run. My heartbeat was no slower now than during my ascent, and I had to stop at times. I was making fast progress, but the distance to the first shelter was still of two miles, and the storm was getting closer faster than I hoped. Rain soon started, and I stopped to put on the raincoat, turn off the cellphone, and get back to run. It took a minute, and it turned into hail. Small, and then thicker. The bigger ones were about half inch in diameter, and they hurt when they hit me. In the meantime, visibility was decreasing to less than 10 meters, and the temperature was dropping like a stone. At first I tried to find shelter amidst thick grass -there was nothing better around, laying down with my face on the ground. This did help for a bit, but I started to question whether it was the right idea to stay put, drenched and cold, while the storm was intensifying. Soon a group of trekkers passed by me, and I decided to go back to the original plan. I kept running fast, and soon overtook the group of other trekkers with some difficulty. I wanted to stay far away from them \u2013 one of them might have some nice metallic target sticking out of their backpacks, and I did not want to start a conversation on the opportunity of throwing away equipment for safety. The overtaking operation cost me a significant effort, and I started to feel really exhausted. I was now running sideways, such that the hail, which was coming from my left pushed by strong winds, would hit my back and not my face. All of this was taxing for my physical strength, which was decreasing quickly. Also, water was flooding the trek now, and running was becoming even more treacherous. But I wanted to get the hell out of there. The first close lightning strikes made it even more clear that I had to rush. And then a strong one hit just behind my back, maybe 100 meters away from me. I did not feel anything except the thunder, and decided it was better to not turn back \u2013 besides, I could barely see anything. So I continued to run. Finally, I got to a shelter \u2013 it was a place where locals were grilling some meat. Wet from head to toe, completely exhausted, I stood there for a few minutes. Then came the guys whom I had overtaken last, before the lightning stroke close to me. And they were shocked. Some of them cried. A guy explained that he had felt the electric discharge going down from his head to his toes, others confirmed having felt the same. Some members of their group were missing, and those around me looked disconcerted. My understanding of Spanish is not so good, but I did understand that they feared for the life of those who were still missing. As the weather was clearing, and I was freezing and exhausted, I decided I was of no use there, and quickly covered the remaining 15 minutes of path to the Teleferiqo. A long queue awaited me, but I saw a sign which said \u201celderly people / respiratory problems / women with small children\u201d. I felt that the first two adjectives perfectly described my current state! It was a sign inviting me to overtake the queue. I did not hesitate and presented myself in front of the operator, with a face that did not need any explanation. \u201cSolo?\u201d \u201cSi, soy solo\u201d. And down I went with the next car. To be fair, I should say that the Teleferiqo does have two queues. Cars host six people, but most of the visitors are in groups and they don\u2019t want to split in different cars, so when the personnel sees people traveling alone they invite them to sneak in the empty seats of a cabin, overtaking the rest of the customers. Back to my hotel room I plunged in the bathtub, where I remained for half an hour. Then I slowly recovered. On the next morning, I was feeling great again, not even pain on the muscles of the legs: a sign that I am in good physical shape indeed. Ready for three straight hours of lectures on the LHC, CMS, and collider physics! So, that is the story. As you can see, I maybe did not really risk my life, or maybe I truly did. For sure, finding yourself in the middle of a storm at 4300 meters of altitude, in sub-zero temperatures, with hail hitting you hard, zero visibility, and not a place to hide is not my ideal excursion. On the other hand it was a very nice adventure, and I feel lucky for what I could experience.
