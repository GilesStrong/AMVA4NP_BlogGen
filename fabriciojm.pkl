V Hi again! So, this time I\u2019m going to tell you about two ideas which are fairly new to me but nonetheless interesting (and, I think, closely related): General searches for new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Black Swan events. The usual framework Since the LHC started operations a few years ago, a significant amount of effort has been put into two endeavours: the search -and its (now almost certain) discovery in 2012- of the Higgs boson and the search for supersymmetry (SUSY) and other extensions of the Standard Model (SM), that is of our current theory for how particles interact with each other. The Higgs boson was known as \u201cthe missing piece\u201d of the SM, a boson that allows itself and other particles to acquire mass. SUSY and other models aim to solve several of the major problems of the SM, such as the so-called naturalness or hierarchy problem and the lack of a Dark Matter candidate. They also predict the existence of new phenomena that can be confirmed or excluded to a certain extent by the experiments at LHC. Long story short: there are good reasons to believe that one of these models actually represents reality, and so we have to build our fancy experiments to check, don\u2019t we? Typically, a search for new physics at the LHC consists in choosing a concrete scenario of an extension of the SM and studying the experimental signatures (i.e. combinations of measured particles) where the new phenomena may manifest themselves. If they don\u2019t, as has been the case so far, we quantify the extent to which our theory is excluded. There are also searches based on specific experimental signatures without being guided by any model, where the theoretical interpretation could happen a posteriori. A counting exercise Hundreds of scientists at the LHC experiments devote their time to search for new physics as described above. The total number of signatures explored by such studies is around 100 or 200, which encompass predictions from the most promising theories beyond the SM. (The numbers and reasoning in this and the following paragraph are taken from here.) But what if we count all possible combinations of measured particles that could be produced in a collision at the LHC? If we take into account up to eight measured particles of five kinds (electrons, photons, muons, jets, b-jets, and neutrinos), the number is already over 1200! The goal of general searches for new phenomena is to close this gap by analyzing the hundreds of signatures that are not taken into account in other studies. Side note:  There are two subtleties in the statement above: Firstly, most general search analyses don\u2019t distinguish electrical charge, meaning that for example the electron and the positron are considered as the same object. Secondly, jets and b-jets are in reality several particles produced in a narrow cone and usually reconstructed as a single object for physics analyses. Intermezzo: Where are the Black Swans? I just started reading Nassim Nicholas Taleb\u2018s acclaimed book \u201cThe Black Swan\u201d, where he describes the impact of highly improbable (a.k.a. Black Swan) events in various areas of knowledge and society. Taleb defines Black Swan events as having three main features: Rarity, in the sense of being outliers to our expectations, Carrying an extreme impact, and Being retrospectively predictable (i.e. only after the event has happened). We do not know when or where could Black Swan events happen, by definition. At best, we can only try to increase our chances to discover Black Swans by being exposed to them. The new physics that may appear in the \u201cgap\u201d signatures is pretty much of the Black Swan kind. Such discovery would be outside of our expectations, since it would correspond to unknown (and un-hypothesized) phenomena. If the discovery of a particle predicted by SUSY would be a game changer, a Black Swan would leave every theorist in the field scratching their heads for a while. Finally, as it has happened in the past with unexpected discoveries, a new theory would be devised to come to the rescue. Looking for whatever, everywhere General searches face the monumental challenge of looking for Black Swan phenomena to make our quest for new physics more robust (or less fragile) to the unexpected. The single assumption made is that new physics will appear in signatures containing particles with high transverse momentum. The idea is to systematically study all possible signatures by looking for a deviation of data from the SM prediction in few variables that are sensitive to new physics. For example, the creation and further decay of a new particle would appear as a \u201cbump\u201d in the spectrum of invariant mass of the decay products. The result of a general search reports all found deviations. The quantity used to assess whether a particular deviation is interesting is the p-value, the probability of a deviation of the SM prediction from the data values. Moreover, the prediction is based on (imperfect) Monte Carlo simulations of the detectors and the SM processes in the collisions; the appearance of a significant deviation would require a more detailed study of the corresponding signature. As a final step, some artificial signal is injected to the data to check if the analysis is sensitive to the presence of new physics. I will explain in more detail how general searches are performed and what has been done in the past, since it is the main subject of my thesis. For now, I leave you with this picture of a real black swan: How do you get the general public interested in physics? How do you show in an accessible way why and how you do physics? How do you convince youngsters to study physics? These are all non-trivial questions, which many physicists have posed themselves when trying to reach out to the general public. Ultimately, their goal is to transmit what Roger Penrose calls \u201cthe excitement of doing physics.\u201d Despite having a growing number of specialists in HEP, some Latin American countries like Venezuela still have a great gap between the scientific community and the general public. Depending on the place and the socio-economic circumstances, one can find twelve-year-olds that know about the existence of the LHC, but also last-year high school students that are misinformed and discouraged about attending the university (even if they don\u2019t have to pay for it), not to mention pursuing a career in science. Part of the problem is also that specialists in specific areas may work abroad, as is the case for most of the Venezuelan experimental high energy physicists. The good news are that there are more and more people worried about these problems that are taking action to address them. CEVALE2: What is it? The \u201cVirtual Center for Higher Studies in High Energy Physics\u201d, CEVALE2, is an initiative to promote and spread the interest in HEP in Latin American countries. Its contributors are mainly Venezuelan scientists working at CERN and physics professors in Venezuela and Colombia, who organize events aiming at different audiences: from the non-scientist public to physics students. I first heard about them a couple of years ago, when they organized an introductory high energy physics course for physics students in three Venezuelan universities, including mine. The program comprised a series of video-conference lectures with an important focus on the physics of the LHC, as well as a hands-on project. The local professors would host the students and arrange the venues for the video-lectures. Although I didn\u2019t enroll in that course (because I had just taken particle physics in Sweden), I could witness the great impact that this course had on the community. More recently, CEVALE2 has also organized seminars, masterclasses and outreach events supported by the Physics Without Frontiers program. The masterclasses are one-day-long sessions for high school students or university freshmen, providing the chance to go through a simple physics analysis using real LHC data. Six institutions from Venezuela and Colombia have hosted these events in the past months. A group of students after a masterclass session at Simón Bolívar University, Venezuela. What should we expect? There is a handful of outcomes that one can already notice from this effort. The course has helped students start a career in particle physics; a few of them have become Summer Students in big labs, like Anabel Romero at CERN and Manuel Morgado at DESY, just to cite two examples from my university. On top of that, the masterclasses and talks always trigger the interest of the general public in the field and potentially lead to choose physics as a career. (These events should never be underestimated, as the first time I considered becoming a physicist was after a screening of The Elegant Universe back in 2007.) Naturally, there are many objectives that are only feasible on a longer term, but this doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be pursued! Founding local research groups, establishing exchange and collaboration agreements, looking for financial support and, why not, eventually have nation-wide collaborations with CERN, are part of the work that CEVALE2 is conducting in Latin America. You can follow the activities of CEVALE2 also in their Twitter and Facebook accounts. This short post is to advertise the CERN Latin American School of High Energy Physics (CLASHEP) 2017 in Mexico. The deadline for applications is the upcoming 18th of November.  The school mainly targets doctoral students in HEP from Latin America, but also welcomes other nationalities and levels (postdocs and master students). If you come from a Latin American country and have funding limitations, CERN may be able to offer financial aid. CLASHEP is a great experience. Academically, I think it is a unique opportunity to meet with the Latin American community in HEP, which has an important (and growing) presence in the field. The activities include a poster session, lectures from experts in different topics and group discussions every day. On top of that, the school is very well planned and usually organizes a few trips to get to know the local culture and explore the nature around! Can you guess why I sound so certain and excited about it? My experience: CLASHEP 2015 About a year and a half ago, I attended the last edition of this school in Ibarra, Ecuador. I remember these three weeks with great joy. Let me summarize this experience in four highlights: Lots of work Every day we had about six hours of lectures plus a couple of hours of group discussion. The level of the lecturers and the group leaders was excellent; you could bring up essentially any question or subject and start a very fruitful discussion. The last ten days, the groups also had to meet without the leader to prepare a final presentation about a paper. The students I was happily surprised by the amount and quality of the attendees. Also, I became friends with several of them (given that the discussions would extend to the night hours over a beer most of the some days). Local impact The school also supported the participation of local undergraduate students and appeared in the newspaper. I am sure that this triggered the interest of some young Ecuadorians to pursue a career in HEP. The rest of the experience Ibarra is a town in the Andes mountains. During the trips we took around we had the chance to discover amazing landscapes, like the Cuicocha lake or some waterfalls (and believe me that coming from Venezuela I have high standards). Last but not least: the food was amazing! And this time the expectations should be even higher, given the richness of Mexican cuisine. CLASHEP 15 I am not eligible to participate in CLASHEP 2017, because I attended the last one, but I\u2019m still looking forward to take part in future editions! ¡Hasta pronto! Feature image taken from the school\u2019s webpage.  This time I\u2019m going to write about the ways of approaching general searches for new phenomena. I invite you to read my previous post to get some context, if you haven\u2019t already. The essence of such searches is to explore as many signatures as possible, without assuming any model of new physics. But how does one do that? During my last visit to CERN, I had the chance to meet in person for the first time with a couple of colleagues from the ATLAS general search group. We discussed, among many other things, the search algorithms used for this kind of analysis. (Simone Amoroso, one of the colleagues I\u2019ve met, presents a concise historical review on general searches in the seventh chapter of his PhD thesis.) In this and the next post, I\u2019ll try to depict two seminal works in the topic, one carried out at the HERA collider (DESY) and the other at the Tevatron (Fermilab). Before moving on, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the first known attempt to perform a general search happened in 1998, using data from L3, one of the experiments of the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) at CERN. There, distributions of several angular and kinematic variables were explored and the comparison between data and simulation was performed using visual inspection or simple tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov or \u03c7². (It\u2019s not my intention to expound on this example, but you can take a look at the note here if you\u2019re interested.) The common ground A first feature appearing in all general searches is the separation of the events into exclusive categories. Each category is defined by a signature; for example, the events identified as \u201cone electron and three jets\u201d will contain exactly that amount of electrons and jets and not more. An algorithm then takes care of searching for discrepancies between the data and simulations. The search is performed automatically in the spectra of chosen variables sensitive to new physics for each category. But searching in many distributions (remember that we\u2019re talking about hundreds of categories) comes with a price to pay: the chance of a spurious discovery rises and one has to adjust for this effect. The H1@HERA way H1 was one of the multi-purpose detectors in the HERA electron-proton and positron-proton collider. The algorithm developed by the H1 collaboration searches for deviations between data and simulations on each binned distribution (four per category, in their case). The following estimator, is used to identify the regions of most interest in the distribution. The definition includes the two cases where the number of events predicted in a region (NSM) is greater or smaller than the one observed (Nobs). The factor A ensures normalization to one. The estimator p is then a convolution of the Poisson probability density function (pdf) with a Gaussian pdf (G) with mean NSM and width \u03b4NSM (i.e. the total systematic uncertainty for the expected events). The Poissonian and Gaussian functions take into account the statistical error and systematic uncertainties in p, respectively. The estimator is interpreted as the p-value which is, as Tommaso has written in a comment of my previous post, the probability of \u201cgetting (\u2026) data at least as discrepant with your model as the ones actually obtained.\u201d Therefore, the most interesting region in a distribution is the one having the smallest p-value, pmin. Here an example: Distribution of the sum of transverse momentum of the objects, in three categories. Taken from here. There are two remaining steps to achieve a sensible result. The first is to calculate the probability P that a deviation with p-value pmin could have happened anywhere in the distribution. Again, the lower P, the more interesting the region selected. The last step is the correction for searching in many categories, which is taken into account by generating pseudo experiments and comparing their values of P with those from the analysis with real data. The figure below shows the comparison in terms of the number of event classes with different values of P. Comparison between the number of categories obtained with different values of P in real H1 data and in pseudo experiments. Taken from here. Side note: A pseudo experiment is a set of hypothetical Monte Carlo-generated histograms following the Standard Model expectation distribution with the same luminosity as the data recorded. This general search was the first to explore all the final states accessible to the experiment, and no significant excesses with respect to the Standard Model were observed. This work has had an influence on other general searches outside H1, as in CDF and most notably in recent CMS and ATLAS studies. That\u2019s all for now. In the post for the second part, I\u2019ll tell you about the other very interesting approach to general searches. Hello there! My name is Fabricio Jiménez and this is my first post in this blog. I have just started my doctoral studies at Université Blaise Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand (France) and am thrilled to take part in the AMVA4NewPhysics Innovative Training Network as an Early Stage Researcher for the next three years. The subject of my thesis will be within a general search for new physics, using statistical learning tools to analyze data taken by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Mugshot picture taken my first day at work. A bit of my background My story starts in Venezuela, a Caribbean country located in the north of South America; I was born in a big town (or a small city, if you will) called San Felipe. To study physics, I moved to the capital and did my undergraduate studies at Universidad Simón Bolívar (USB) \u2013 an excellent and gorgeous university near the mountains just outside Caracas. During my first years at USB I realized that most of the work in physics is done in collaboration, often with colleagues abroad. I found it fascinating that science is a truly universal language. I was happy with the idea of traveling to study and work, and luckily that\u2019s what has actually happened. Last picture I took at the main garden of USB, my home university. I could go on and explain in detail each of my work experiences before starting my PhD, but it\u2019s perhaps a better idea to leave them for other posts. In short, I\u2019ve spent my last year of undergrad as an exchange student at Lund University (Sweden), working with the production of heavy quarks in parton showers using the Pythia Monte Carlo (MC) event generator. (Please take a look at Giles\u2019 neat articles about event generation and heavy flavour production in MC.) Lund University\u2019s main building at the end of the winter. Then, I was a Summer Student at CERN and worked on the search for production of pairs of Higgs bosons (using the CMS detector). The topic has also been discussed in this blog several times, for example in posts from Juan Rojo and from Pablo de Castro. After finally getting my degree in Venezuela last year, I spent last summer at Fermilab. I worked in an R&D project for the upgrade of the tracking trigger system of the CMS detector, designed to cope with the future requirements imposed by High-Luminosity conditions at the LHC. Last fall, I came to France to pursue my Master studies at Paris VII University. Living in Paris was a unique experience, and I was very lucky to have very good (and intense) lectures and to share with other physics students from Paris VI and Paris XI universities. For the last three months of that program, I decided to make my internship with the CMS group at IPN-Lyon, in the search for a second, low-mass Higgs boson in the diphoton channel; specifically in photon identification using boosted decision trees. Finally, I heard about the announcement of the PhD position with AMVA4NewPhysics in Clermont-Ferrand. Being an Early Stage Researcher in this network will allow me to further explore many of my interests in particle physics, while using statistical learning tools and to connect with many academic institutes, universities and the industry. I found the offer so interesting that it was not a problem to move places for the eighth time in two years! More than physics When I am not doing physics, I spend most of my time hearing and playing music, particularly from Brazil and Venezuela. I initially studied classical guitar for a couple of years, but now I like to explore popular music, and even started learning how to play cuatro, a Venezuelan four-stringed guitar! Other than music, I also enjoy cooking, hiking and playing ping-pong. See you next time! This is the time of the year when I start to reach out to as many undergraduates in physics (and similar subjects) as possible. My yearly mantra for them: \u201cApply to summer internships!\u201d I cannot emphasize how much my two internships shaped my life and career, from fortuitously having breakfast with a Nobel laureate, the living legend Jack Steinberger (and maybe a story to tell in another post) to hands-on work in physics analyses for the LHC and making friends from all across the globe. This post is not intended to explain in any detail my work during those internships; however, if you are interested, I worked searching for double Higgs production during Run 1 at CERN and for the level-1 trigger upgrade at Fermilab, both within the CMS collaboration. Instead, I\u2019ll try to give you some information and advice that should convince you to give it a try, in case you are in doubt. Usually, people come up with two obstacles when facing this situation, telling themselves: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not smart enough to go to CERN [or any other lab]\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t have money for that.\u201d There are many ways in which you can address the first issue, a short one would be: what does even \u201csmart enough\u201d mean? Good grades? Publications? Grading systems vary all across the world (for example: 18/20 in France \u2260 3.6/4 in the US) and you are not expected to already have publications when you are an undergrad. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if you have good grades and publications that\u2019s great and I also don\u2019t want to sound apologetic towards those that are not committed to their career. However, I have witnessed how the ones who are genuinely interested in physics (with excelling grades or not, zero or N early publications) actually end up being good at research. The lack of financial resources can appear as more difficult to overcome. In particular, for an average student in a public university like mine in Venezuela, just paying a flight abroad is currently, to say the least, far beyond reach. Well, you should know that several internship programs do cover living costs and could also pay (or reimburse) for traveling expenses. This of course varies from program to program and you should read very carefully what the internship can offer: sometimes financial aid is provided by default or upon request, and sometimes fully or partially. (Don\u2019t be afraid or ashamed to ask them!) I have also seen many successful online fundraising campaigns to afford plane tickets, lodging and food for the first days, etc.. In any case, I think this is the kind of issue you should worry about after you get accepted. Now that you hopefully have a hint on how to overcome two of the more common obstacles, I\u2019m going to tell you what I think matters more than grades and money for this kind of applications: prepare a good motivation letter / statement of purpose and provide good recommendation letters. Any professor that has taught you any course or supervised you is a candidate for recommending you; needless to say, it has to be someone that (at least, you believe) has a good impression of you, i.e. someone who can say: \u201cHey, I know this student personally and know good reasons why him/her should get in your program.\u201d (Sanity tip: ask them *at least* two weeks before deadline.) Regarding how to make a good statement, you may find plenty of advice online; also, use input for college, grad school and job applications in general. A couple of examples are here and here. My final advice is the same as the first: apply to Summer internships, to all of them! Really, you have nothing to loose and potentially lots to gain, regardless if it is in a local lab or in another continent. Got rejected? Well, it happens to you, to me, and pretty much everybody around, and, spoiler alert: it will most likely happen again many times. It just requires patience and perseverance. There are even (well-accomplished) people that have published a list of positions they didn\u2019t get. Below I\u2019m going to leave you a list of three internships in HEP that I know about, but I\u2019m sure that there are more around. If you happen to know about another one, please comment it here! CERN Summer Student program: Relevant links: for people from member States and non-member States Deadline: January 28th, 2018 (already open!) Stipend to cover living costs + travel allowance (reimbursed) DESY Summer Student program: Relevant link. Deadline: January 31st, 2018 (application period starts on December 15th) Stipend to cover living costs + travel subsidy. Fermilab Internship programs: Link to all programs. Unfortunately, the IPM program that I attended (open to all nationalities) is not active any longer. Please read the details about eligibility and deadlines on the webpages for programs and partnerships with countries. At the time I attended, a stipend and accommodation were provided. I had to cover travel expenses. A few years ago, back when I was a Summer Student at CERN, me and other physics students had some debate on the origins of the word \u201chysteresis.\u201d We were just coming back from CinéTransat \u2013 an open-air cinema at La Perle du Lac park in Geneva, and having a random chat until Sabina jokingly accused Josefa of being hysteric, for a reason I can\u2019t remember right now. From there, they started a discussion on how the word \u201chysteric\u201d was related to \u201cuterus\u201d (at some point in the past, hysteria was defined as a psychological disorder related to the organ), and to \u201chysterectomy\u201d (the removal of the organ). Very naïvely, I added what I once heard and believed, that \u201chysteresis\u201d may also be part of this family of words; looking so similar, I suspected that this was the case, but haven\u2019t checked by myself why. Sabina and Josefa with their smartphones quickly jumped in to refute my claim, citing the different meanings of the respective words: \u201cuterus\u201d comes from the Ancient Greek word for womb, whereas \u201chysteresis\u201d from the version of \u201cdelay\u201d or \u201clate\u201d in the same language. Sabina guilefully added that she \u201cbroke a myth\u201d for me. Now, there is something straightforward for physicists: the connection between hysteresis and delay. A system is said to present hysteresis if in a given moment its state is lagged with respect to the effect that produced such state; in this context it is often said that the system \u201ckeeps a memory\u201d from the past. A common example appears in electromagnetism: in the presence of an external magnetic field, a ferromagnet gets magnetized (i.e. generates its own magnetic field because of the external one) and such effect stays even after the external magnetic field is not present anymore. Moreover, the intensity of the magnetization does not follow exactly the one from the external field, but it is instead delayed with respect to it at any given moment. When I came back home scratching my head because of the origin of these words, my research was not very fruitful. I could only point out that the Ancient Greek roots of the words looked similar, but the meanings differed: hysteria comes from the word for uterus \u201chusterá\u201d (\u03c5\u0314\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u0301\u03c1\u03b1), whereas hysteresis (\u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) comes from \u201cdelay\u201d \u2013 \u201chusteros\u201d (\u1f51\u0301\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2). At the time I went on to ask Mina, a Greek friend and a physics student, about my quest for which she had no immediate answer. After some days, however, she came with an answer from her uncle (who has knowledge in the ancient language) that pointed very much towards a relation between the words. Before going to the dénouement of my story, I have to say that for the purpose of writing this blog post I relaunched my hysteresis-hysteria search in order to confirm what I\u2019ve got in the past. This included discussions with several members of the Network, a few of which have taken Ancient Greek courses at some point. The crucial information finally came from a friend of Cecilia, who\u2019s a doctoral student in Philology and Linguistics in her university. The explanation from Cecilia\u2019s friend reads something like this: hysteresis comes from \u201chusteros,\u201d that means \u201cadditional, posterior\u201d but also \u201cmore external\u201d and from here the word \u201cuterus\u201d was used to designate the pregnant belly, or the \u201cmore external part\u201d of the body; in ancient times, the knowledge in anatomy was not as precise as it is today. In a different version, Mina\u2019s uncle said that the relation was given by the delay with which the placenta is expelled after a woman gives birth to a child; the placenta and other organs were accordingly named after this peculiarity. Either way the words are linked! In my attempt to \u201cglue a myth back together,\u201d I remembered a beautiful book written by Isaac Asimov, that my dad gave me when I was about 12. \u201cWords from the Myths\u201d tells many fascinating stories on how commonly-used words have their roots in ancient myths. This book sparked my interest in knowing how words are originated \u2013 I strongly recommend you to read it! The time for my first secondment is about to arrive and I have to say that reading previous stories in this blog has set the bar high for this new experience. We are aiming to start a collaborative work between my lab at Blaise Pascal University and the Statistics Department at the University of Padova (UNIPD), with two secondments planned: mine during next February in Padova and Greg\u2019s here in Clermont-Ferrand in a couple of months. The Secondment The main goal of the secondment is to work on Statistical Learning algorithms such as the ones using Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering, a subject of research at UNIPD, with potential applications in searches for new physics. Greg has already written a nice post about these models, also citing an example in High-Energy Physics. In upcoming posts I\u2019ll give more details on the subject and how we can make use of them in General Searches for New Physics \u2014 ultimately, the goal of my doctoral studies. While arranging my stay in Padova, there were two interesting points raised in a discussion with the statisticians. Firstly, as pointed out by Cecilia, language can be a barrier. This is not necessarily difficult to overcome, but sure it can introduce some confusion to a discussion (for example, \u201cnormal\u201d could mean either \u201cgaussian\u201d or \u201cwithout anomaly\u201d in different contexts). Also, on a more practical side, the programming languages commonly used by statisticians and physicists are not necessarily the same. Secondly, we have to figure out a way to provide data for our studies that is both useful for physics searches and \u201clegal.\u201d With the last I mean that it is not possible to analyze data from an experiment like ATLAS with people who is not affiliated to the collaboration (like the colleagues in Padova), at least before the official analyses have been published. Soft Skills? Just before the beginning of my secondment, our Network is hosting a workshop on soft skills in Padova during the first three days of February. I have to admit that the first time I\u2019ve come up with the term \u201csoft skill\u201d was when I heard about this workshop, not long ago. Now that my academic expertise on the subject is at the level of the first results of a Google search, I realize that such skills (that include effective communication, language skills, empathy and teamwork) are necessary in virtually any job. A good handle of them can be very suitable for solving the issues I just described above! Since I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to Oxford to attend our last workshop in December (I was visiting my home country at the time), this one will be my chance to finally meet in person with the rest of the ESRs as well as the other members based in Padova. This link with colleagues around Europe is important not only for academic purposes, but also can really get you out of trouble, for example, to find accommodation in Padova (thanks, Cecilia!) or if you happen to miss a flight home in Lisbon (thanks Giles, even if you were in Japan!). I hope to come back soon with more about Statistical Learning and New Physics in Padova and, why not, something about the wines from Valpolicella and panini alla porchetta.
